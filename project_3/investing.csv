3,investing,I have 4 begginer level questions about stocks pls anwser im begging.,"First is about the bid-ask spread, if the bid is 8 dollars and the ask is 10, the bidder will still pay 10 dollars and the ask will receive 8 correct? So what is the point of the bidder doing a bid if he is going to pay the full amount? Does he choose how much money goes to spread and how much to the seller?

The second question is how is it beneficial in the long term for a company to give shares if the profits are going to shareholders?

The third question is about crypto, why would crypto be in demand if we can just use regular currency

The fourth question is about stock dividends, if a company pays you in stocks instead of money, how would you make money from that?",1632488005
6,investing,Should you follow insider transactions? - I analyzed 4000+ insider trades made over the last 4 years and benchmarked the performance against S&amp;P 500. Here are the results!,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.

&gt;There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.

If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!

It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?

In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**

___

**Data**

The data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**

it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \[1\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.

* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.
* A minimum transaction value of 100K
* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)

The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

___

**Analysis**

For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months &amp; 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&amp;P500 over the same time period.

My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.

___

 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**

|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&amp;P 500 Returns|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1-Week|1.9%|\-0.3%|2.1%|
|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|
|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|
|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|
|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|

Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&amp;P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.

I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.

___ 

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.

* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&amp;P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \[2\]
* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)
* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\[3\]

___

**Conclusion**

Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.

This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \[4\].

You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

Until next week…

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.

Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%

\[3\] Very few people have the ability to keep their emotions away from the trades when a significant chunk of their money is at stake.

22,investing,Predicting Financial Crashes Using Discrete Scale Invariance [Research paper]," 

Read in full here - [arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 8 Jun 1999](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf)

**Introduction**

Two recent papers \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al., 2000\] have presented increasing evidence on the Oct. 1929, Oct. 1987, Hong-Kong Oct. 1987 crashes, on the Aug. 1998 global market events and on the 1985 Forex event on the US dollar, for the following hypothesis \[Sornette et al, 1996\] describing stock market crashes : we propose that they are caused by a slow build-up of long-range time correlations reflecting those between traders leading to a collapse of the stock market in one critical instant.

This build-up manifest itself as an over-all power law acceleration in the price decorated by “log-periodic” precursors. Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.

In addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed \[Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997\] to show that the reported “logperiodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected

**Conclusion**

We have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.

We have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.

In addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 \[Johansen et al., 2000\] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999c\].

Quite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.

To our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a logperiodic signature.

In this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.

All these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.

In our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.

These different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.

This is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.

We have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms \[Sornette, 1998\] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.",1632451430

**Earning Results: (Beat on top line + Beat on the bottom line + Raised Guidance)**

BlackBerry revenue of $175M beat consensus by $11M, with Cybersecurity beating by $3M, IoT beating by another $3M and Licensing beating by $5M. Shares have been up 8-10% after hours. I personally can't remember the last time BlackBerry had a revenue beat.

1. Top 10 automotive OEM chose BlackBerry Protect &amp; Optics, after going head-to-head against CrowdStrike
2. Fortune 100 financial firm chose BlackBerry Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Microsoft Defender
3. Australian Gov chose BlackBerry Protect &amp; Optics, displacing Trend Micro and Symantec Norton Life Lock

**Patent Sale Date:**

John Chen on the conference call said price has been decided and 80% chance the rest gets closed/announced before the end of this quarter (before year end)

What’s interesting is that he said he’s got other buyers lined up and that the current company (or companies) had exclusive negotiating rights

With billions being thrown around in this space, he’s going to get a VERY good price for his IP (Intellectual Property)/licensing

36,investing,NIKE - earnings report and my opinion,"  

„Nike reports earnings tonight for their first financial quarter of 2022 (covering the months June-August 2021). The consensus revenue estimate calls for 12.54bn in revenue (1.6% q-o-q increase), with the highest estimate pegged at 12.9bn in revenue (4.6% q-o-q increase). Estimates call for EPS of 1.12, which has recently been revised downward slightly as people are worried about supply chain issues in Vietnam (more on that later).

Nike's brand strength and pricing power is unparalleled among retailers, and I think they will outdo the revenue expectations and see a decent upwards bump in price. Store reopenings in Europe and coastal USA should work in their favor this quarter, while they still benefit from tremendously strong digital channels.

**Store visits**

While May and June were comparatively weak, according to this data Nike did very well in July and August to make up for it. They outperformed especially in New York and California, while being approximately on par with Lulu in Texas and Florida. According to Linkedin, they have also increased their sales personnel by 3% over the past 6 months.

**Website visits**

Nike has also seen a nice uptick in website hits in recent months. According to Similarweb, their website had a total of 361.5 million from June-August, compared to 330 million in the previous 3 months, for a 10% increase 

**Risks**

This is probably one of the riskier plays I’ve posted here since expectations for Nike are actually quite high. The main reason I’m even posting it is that they dropped quite a lot in the past weeks and it’s looking oversold, and the overall market looks strong right now. Don’t bet the house on this one.

Nike had fantastic earnings and a huge jump 3 months ago, and is now trading a couple percent above that level. It's somewhat uncommon (but not unheard of) for stocks to have 2 big jumps after consecutive earnings reports.

The Put-call open interest ratio is skewed towards put, which indicates people are generally bullish. This play more or less goes along with the consensus view, which isn’t always the right move.

Supply chain issues might be worse than I estimate. Even if they aren’t, Nike might decide to lowball guidance to play it safe. I'm not Vietnamese, don't read Vietnamese, and don't know anyone in Vietnam. I have no idea how bad the supply chain issue will be - I am simply making an educated guess based on publicly available English-language sources.“",1632439014

Quick q from a trading perspective. 

If you have one security that is listed and trade on different exchanges, i.e. has a London line / Australian line, or London line / ADR, etc... when fx'ing the share prices to a common currency, we'd expect them to trade in line with one another (law of one price, else arbitrage).

If the securities prices have been trading a siginificant spread over time - what would you attribute this to? Valuation of the sum of parts in the London book vs Aussie line being justified through their P/E? etc.

31,investing,US bond lobbies warn SEC of severe disruption under rule change,"Lobby groups are warning that activity in the world’s biggest bond market could grind to a halt at the end of this month without last-minute exemptions to an obscure 50-year-old rule in the US that has previously taken aim only at stocks.

Bond trade associations have written to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply. The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.

“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. 

The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.

“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.

The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.

But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. 

“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.

The SEC declined to comment. 

Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. 

The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. 

The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. 

Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.

Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. 

“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.",1632370009

The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming[ F-150 Lightning pickup truck](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/). Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.

Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.

“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”

All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.

Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.

“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  

Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.

In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.

The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.

The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was [more than $700 million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/).)

It also revealed in September plans to [expand its business](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/) beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.

The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.

How does career in private equity really chart up?

Is PE a number crunching job (at junior level positions) with negotiations; only when you go higher up?  
How necessary is it necessary to be clever and street smart in order to succeed in private equity?

Do investment banks and PE firms take analysts from regular or lower level colleges such as Hult or DePaul or does Buy Side Finance only put attention only to Ivy League institutions.  
I got 55% in my graduation (90% and 95% in 2 other investment courses from NISM, India) and I am planning for Masters in US.

Though I am already receiving admission offers since my GRE score is 320; I am really wondering weather those colleges get you in big bracket Investment Bank's M&amp;A / Corporate Finance depts slide into Private Equity

Is double Masters a good opinion, to get your foot in the door now thru any college giving Masters and after 5-6 years pursue MBA from a Ivy League to shoot your shot

8,investing,What's the best way to diversify your portfolio?,"Diversifying my portfolio is currently my goal ever since I started investing on mining stocks last year. When I started though, I was focused on the bigger ones like FCX and NEM, since these are stocks that you can feel sure and secure in my perspective.

Though recently I came across some juniors that I invested on. Among them is Fortitude Gold ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/)), which despite being a small producer, has no debts. They[ ](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-increases-monthly-dividend)[reported positive metallurgical test results](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-reports-positive-golden-mile-metallurgical-test-results) from its Golden Mile property with column leach tests reporting up to 85% gold recovery. I got[ Lithium Corporation](https://www.lithiumcorporation.com/) ($LTUM) because I think there is probably a better return on energy metals in the future. ie lithium, cobalt, graphite, etc. in my perspective.

Also got some from[ Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) ([CNL.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)). The announcement from last month detailed results about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling and they already started drilling last week. Their cash burn is also impressively low, making the company set for a long timeline. There is a possibility that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than the previous discovery, since they recently announced a potential gold porphyry stockwork system at their Victory target area.

I know it’s kind of risky investing on these but I believe it’s a high-risk high-reward thing. They entail higher risk but we cannot ignore their strong profit potential especially with those who already started drilling and are showing great promise. I'm still looking into investing in some more though. What other stocks are doing really well? I want to start moving away from metals though I'm still thinking if that's a smart decision.",1632320610

33,investing,Why does nobody have more than 10% REITs in their portfolio?,"I have two questions:

1) For years I've been thinking about REITs vs Rental Properties.

Fact is: I hate managing tenants and taking out a loan in my country is not that optimal (I have cash anyway). For this reason I am leaning towards REITs but I know so little about them, I don't know where to begin.

Do you think REITs better in my situation? Any opinion helps.

2) No big investor has more than a few percent invested in REITs (Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Lynn Alden etc.).

So if REITs are so good, why don't investors buy more REITs?

On the flip side, investors who are real estate oriented have 50%+ of their portfolios in physical real estate. 

Why is there no big investor with a portfolio that is at least 50% REITs?

l'idée est surtout de développer des outils décentralisés avec Hedera, pas d'augmenter le volume de transactions spéculatives qui n'est finalement qu'une niche, ils veulent ajouter de la valeur dans les transactions et augmenter le volume (ex : décentralisé le KYC, le paiement, le track record des opérations et leur traitement comptable, l'emprunte carbone digitale par utilisateur, etc…) le DLT de Hedera est le plus régulé au monde, (une fois que les régulateurs vont secouer le cocotier on verra ceux qui restent en place)Un régulateur peut imposer un arrêt net des opérations des acteurs décentralisés et donc tué son business du jour au lendemain… ce sera pas le cas avec un partenaire comme Hedera

72,investing,Why is no one talking about the Credit Default SWAPs tied to Evergrande's USD 300 Billion Debt,"A credit default swap is "" a financial contract whereby a buyer of corporate or sovereign debt in the form of bonds attempts to eliminate possible loss arising from default by the issuer of the bonds. This is achieved by the issuer of the bonds insuring the buyer’s potential losses as part of the agreement. ""   


Essentially, it is insurance for the creditor in the case of default from a debtor. 

A creditor can get into these credit default swaps contracts, where a creditor pays a fixed amount to another party (the insurer) and when/if the debtor to the creditor defaults  the insurer will step in to make the creditor whole.

Now, people have known about Evergrande and their liquidity issues for about a year. Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.   


Now, apparently this week is full of holidays for China - so TOMORROW, when a good chunk of China is back to work AND when China is expected make an announcement as to whether or not they will SAVE Evergrande or let it default, THEN we  will find out how the markets truly respond to this catastrophe.  


**What would be the effect of the credit default swaps on the rest of the financial markets?** Obviously, we don't know who the insurers are, but I'd imagine that that insurer is probably issuing securities out of its pooled credit default payments. Like all insurance companies.  
FYI, Credit Default Swaps are what really hurt AIG during the 2008 housing crisis.

Side note: Everyone is expecting China to step in and save Evergrande or at least prevent contagion effects throughout the chinese markets.

Although questions of underlying ideology may be dismissed by “practical” individuals who pride themselves on being “independent thinkers,” Austrian economics accounts for the degree to which our intellectual environment directly guides policy and institutional frameworks. In the aftermath of the challenging times that may be ahead, the only way to build a stronger, more prosperous, and more stable future will be with an ideological revolution.

90,investing,Researching Lenders for Purchasing,"Hello,

I am looking to make my first real investments in the stock market, I am doing some research into sectors that I feel might benefit in the long term.

My area of competency is technology, my theory is that most governments are moving towards Net-Zero emissions in the next few years forcing the sale of Electric Vehicles. I don’t think the price of batteries will come down all too much as historically there has been minimal improvement in the space - although I do support this innovation I think cars will be expensive for next few decades.

This leads me to believe that most consumers will finance a vehicle rather than selling it, and this seems to be a popular option even in today’s market.

I am trying to find companies that lend money primarily for the purpose of a car loan but searching through google just leads me to endless advertisements. I am really struggling to find good information about how the business model actually works.

Can anyone shed some light on this subject? Do car makers deal with the financial services themselves? Do people go to banks for this or are there a list of companies I can compare to gauge the historic performance of this model to see if it is the right investment for me?

93,investing,Is there a certain amount of leverage that is essentially risk free?,"I've put together an Excel Monte Carlo simulation which shows a portfolio carrying a small amount of leverage (meaning 1.2 assets to equity) on an initial deposit with no rebalancing, would imply roughly a 1-2% risk of exceeding the Reg T margin limit over a 25 year period. However, it seems almost too good to be true that you could leverage up this much with so little risk.

\- Potential Gamma Squeeze, SPAC merging with Moneylion

\- Trusting someone who predicted SPRT :)

The mutual fund has an active money manager who would manage the money you put in based on some investment theses but can make active changes to maximise returns and getting money in and out of the mutual fund is not always instant.

38,investing,Dividends make absolutely no sense and its driving me nuts.,"I hear people constantly praising dividends like it's the best thing of a stock. I hear from basic stock explanations that ""A stockholder makes their money from dividends"". I hear people say that dividends give them a steady stream of income. I hear people say that dividends give them an option on whether to reinvest in a company or take home the money.

None of those arguements hold any weight at all. A dividend has a tax attached to it eating into your returns. A dividend literally eats into the value of your stock; 1% dividend is 1% decrease in stock value. You can literally sell the stock to collect your money on a regular basis, we have fractional shares you know.

I am at the point of wonder why do we even buy stocks. What is the egg of the chicken? What is the underlying reason to why we buy stocks, and why they are worth anything?

Still sitting on some more cash waiting to go in. Had a bigger ""emergency"" fund before, so missed out on all of the ride up sitting in a hysa.

But once I decided to go for it with the S&amp;P, I started DCA in and pretty much went in at all the highs.

I wasn't there for the ride up, so just being there for the ride down doesn't seem that appealing.

I am keeping what I already put into the S&amp;P. I just added some more at the latest near high last week.

Hoping to at least put the rest of the large sum in when it's near a low, so I am there for the ride up for that part.

I know time in the market is more important than timing the market overall. And I am doing that overall. But I wasn't there for the ride up, so I am somewhat conflicted.

What do you guys think and are we heading down a bit? Since I waited so long already missing out on all the gains, might it not make sense to wait a little more and actually go in at a lower point, to not end up going in only at highs?

I'm a young guy with quite a lot of money very regularly coming in due to a Web3 project I have taking off. I live modestly and have been putting probably 80% of my income into investments. I've set a pretty comfortable risk tolerance, and my time horizon is more than 20 years.

I've found myself buying into $VOO on regular intervals lately. It feels safe, doesn't take a lot of time, etc. I've gradually been scaling into using margin, because I strongly believe that, over my time horizon, the returns I'll get from an S&amp;P index fund will beat out the 0.75% interest rate they offer me.

However, I learned about leveraged S&amp;P ETFs recently, such as $SPUU, $SSO, $UPRO. These mostly seem to have a higher expense ratio than $VOO, but my understanding is that these are able to achieve a similar leverage affect of using margin in the way I am, without using margin.

I was just wondering if I'm understanding this correctly. If I'm comfortable going in 1:1 on margin into $VOO, am I then better off just buying $SPUU and not using margin instead (assuming the expense ratios are in my favor). Are there any differences or disadvantages of these leveraged ETFs that I'm not understanding, when compared to going into $VOO on margin?",1632172883
63,investing,Had an interesting test today for my “all-weather” portfolio,"I have over $1 million in my IRA,  100% invested in VTS. I won’t touch this nest egg for at least another 10-15 years and maybe longer. This is truly my buy-and-hold account.

So obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.

I have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.

This is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.

For this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).

This portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.

Here is how I have invested this $10,000:

* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

So far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. 

I have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.

As I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.

I have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.

I recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk. If it’s money you don’t want to risk losing this might be worth checking out.",1632170372

# Overview

Cepton provides state-of-the-art, intelligent, lidar-based solutions for a range of markets such as automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications. Cepton’s patented MMT®-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.

  

From the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:

 - automotive grade
 - small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance
 - ultra competitive price (tech advantage)
 - partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)

  

Founded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.

  

Cepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **GCAC.** A [press statement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html) released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the Q4 2021"". The S-4 was filed September 8th, 2021, and is available [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29).

# Competition

  

Innoviz, Microvision, Velodyne, Aeva, Ouster, Aeye, Luminar

  

Cepton has a huge leg up on its competitors by having the largest production award (GM) as well as partnership with a key tier 1 supplier (Koito). According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.

  

Microvision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.

  

Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.

As of writing this, GCAC is trading at $9.89, below the theoretical floor of $10 for SPACs.

  
  
  

# Bear Cases 

  

The merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. 

  

Cepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. 

  

The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at.

# Conclusion

  

Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.

  

As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.

While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. 

  
  
  

**Game plan**  

I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. 

You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.
  
- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts

  
  

**TL;DR:** 

Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.

6,investing,China’s growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios,"Assumptions…
- 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)
- Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday
- 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 
- China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already
- a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the regulatory actions of Chinese tech companies, hence sentiment sensibility is heightened



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services). Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderate sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


3.) Orderly containment - small spill over
Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with large leverage). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep property prices stable, the spill over effects would be barely visible.

-&gt; only short-term / slight impact on international markets (selected sectors only)",1632148733
9,investing,How to increase my exposure on a dividend play?,"Hey everyone

I’m long $VALE and have been since $10/share. They’re trading at a 35% discount from their high a month ago($22) at $15/share and just announced a $1.5 (10%!!) dividend. 

This feels like free $ to me, and it will be since I own so much stock.


Now, I have more $ in a brokerage account solely dedicated to derivatives. Is there any way that I could simultaneously bet on the stock price rising or not falling while also being able to suck up much of this dividend?

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

69,investing,What Questions To Ask Your Potential Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor,"I know many of you reading this are DIY investors, and that is absolutely great!  For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the ""Interview Process"".  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren't best suited for you.

1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? 

You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.

2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?

Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.

3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?

You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.

4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?

FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.

5.       How secure are your services?

Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.

6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?

FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.

7.       How are you getting paid?

For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.

8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you

This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.

Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:

* What is passive vs. active investing?
* How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?
* What is a [laddered bond](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders) portfolio?
* How do you determine how much money I can safely withdraw each year without running out?

71,investing,Considering moving out of GE,"Hello all, I have a small portfolio meant specifically to be a long hold. I'm only 35 and have plenty of time to build.

89,investing,Three types of tech companies,"&amp;#x200B;

**There are three reasons that are preventing tech companies from growing faster:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Tech companies that don't have enough money.**

These are generally start-ups, or high-burn hungry tech companies. 

This manifests in two different ways:

1. Companies actively burning money, to show ""growth"" that is unsustainable.
2. Companies actively choosing to spend money, because they know it is going to pay off in the future (e.g. amazon spending billions on infrastructure). 

Avoid the former. Invest in the later.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Tech companies that don't have enough talent.**

This manifests in two different ways.

1. High quality people don't want to work there. (avoid these companies). 
2. The company grew so fast, and hiring is still catching up (hyper growth co's). E.g. Zoom, Instacart, DoorDash, after covid. 

Avoid the former reason (not easily solved). Invest in the later (easily solved).

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Tech companies that don't have enough opportunities to spend.**

These are companies that just don't have enough opportunities to deploy $ or people. Typically companies with poor markets.

Avoid this category, *unless*, you see a market shift or external shift in the market.",1632079862

So why is this ETF so bad?

I have held TQQQ since before the crash of 2020, and while it was a bumpy ride, I've continued making it a bigger component of my portfolio, happily enjoying the returns.

99,investing,No Free Lunch: A Brief Primer on the Cost vs. Value of Information,"There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?

There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry^(1):

1. Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.
2. Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.
3. This information is cheap.

Beyond Time Value of Money, there's no more valuable information you're going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it's not ""free"".  You've deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it's often called ""Due Diligence"" here).  These reports cost money, and they're compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.

So I'm sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:

1. Smith and Roberson's *Business Law.*
2. *Fundamentals of Financial Management* by Eugene F. Brigham.
3. *Management Accounting* by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).
4. *Security Analysis* by Dodd and Graham.

The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it's more widely used than in academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that's just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.

Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.

So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn't pay for it, chances are it's not that valuable.

69,investing,Private company has been misleading about its capabilities.,"Hi. I'm a stenographer in New York. I run a blog devoted to my industry. I'd been following the Verbit company for some time. During its series A funding, it was talking about 99% accuracy in record time with its automatic speech recognition stuff. By its series B funding it was saying it would use human transcribers, because despite everyone's belief that automatic speech recognition can do what we do, there's actually some evidence from the racial disparities in automatic speech recognition study that's not true. 

So I know your subreddit appears to be geared toward public investing, but obviously, I see this as private equity throwing big money at what is likely to turn out to be a zombie company. You can draw a comparison with VIQ Solutions, which has not been profitable for as long as I've followed it. I'm wondering if any of you have involvement with those kinds of private funds, or how one would even get word to them that all is not as it seems.

There are also social and legal reasons I care about this, but I will mostly omit that here since it's more or less irrelevant to the topic of investing beyond the obvious point that they're trying to gain ground into a field that has a lot of competitors and in all likelihood the unicorn will become a money burn like Google's Deep Mind.

82,investing,Is waiting for a dip the best investment strategy? - I analyzed last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&amp;P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

 

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

 As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

Author claims no responsibility for the accuracy of the facts and statements in this report. The investment (""YOLO"") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*

**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.

\------

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

**Background**

Atlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (""Airline Operations"") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.

You may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.

**Short Term Prospects**

Beyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?

**Long Term Prospects**

As a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, ""Air Freight""):

&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  
Supply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.

(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)

**Short Interest**

For some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Okay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google ""AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call""). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:

&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.

I simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.",1631829856

Same with SPY, I can go look at the S&amp;P 500 components and buy the same companies with the same weight.

My theory is that this way if I invest my 3 accounts in indexed sp500 funds, over the next 17 years I will come out with much better gains than I would doing say a 70/30 split...THEN once I turn 50 I can assess how the market looks, maybe pull back a bit from 50-55 and if things are going ok at 70/30 I can go all bonds there on out and know my money won't plummet and sleep tight at night...if the market takes a shit when I am 50 then I can just work a couple extra years and wait for things to get back on track then go all Bonds...

(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awarded $110 million to a tipster whose information resulted in enforcement actions, bringing total payments under the agency’s whistle-blower program to more than $1 billion.

The tipster’s award, the second-largest ever, includes $40 million from the SEC and $70 million from a related action brought by another agency, according to a statement Wednesday. Under the SEC’s whistle-blower program, tipsters can be paid for information that prompts sanctions by another agency. 

“Today’s announcement underscores the important role that whistle-blowers play in helping the SEC detect, investigate and prosecute potential violations of the securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement. “The assistance that whistle-blowers provide is crucial to the SEC’s ability to enforce the rules of the road for our capital markets.”

The SEC has made disbursements to 207 tipsters since issuing its first award in 2012. Individuals are eligible for payments ranging from 10% to 30% of the fines collected in enforcement cases where penalties exceed $1 million. Funds used to pay tipsters don’t come out of disgorgement, the portion of a sanction that’s supposed to be returned to harmed investors.

Neither the whistle-blowers nor the firms accused of misconduct were identified by the SEC, in keeping with the federal government’s policy of withholding information that could reveal a tipster’s identity.",1631789764
6,investing,Is there any point in investing in anything else than S&amp;P500 + my country index?,"Goal: put money into some position, forget about it for decades.

There's this statistic around that ~90% of investors underperform the market. A safe (-ish) and easy way of investing is therefore to just dump money into an index, especially for long term growth. 

The world economy is heavily linked to the US economy, which is best represented by the S&amp;P500 because this index is very general and has a lot of companies. The S&amp;P500 has grown a lot all through history, and there is never a point where the world economy grows yet the S&amp;P does not. So whenever there is something to gain, you will gain with just following S&amp;P.

Then, if you live in a non-US country you might want some exposure to your own country economy. Because that's where you will be earning and spending money in general. I live in Switzerland, which is a rich and stable country, so I can hold savings in the SMI index and they will follow Swiss economy.

21,investing,Lesser-known stocks that supply popular industries,"We see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. 

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus a small cap company looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's comment describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It'll double or triple in a couple years.

&gt;I'm an engineer focused on raw materials, so I'm a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.

Do you agree with this investment philosophy? What are some other supplier stocks you hold or have looked into?",1631766870
25,investing,Theoretical question about the benefits of using Smartlands vs. traditional refinancing.,"
So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky. Maybe I am just not savvy enough on the costs associated with taking cash out of commercial properties. I'm quite excited about this project regardless for the SME side but any clarification on the real estate side would be appreciated.",1631764757

Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. 

My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: 

$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. 

$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. 

Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. 

What are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",1631744925
50,investing,Future options far out. Question? Quicker money?,"So I’m wondering if I buy a far out option and say the option is in my favor for 2 days. And I invest a lot, would I make that much? Example in the picture. Using RH as an example (I don’t use it tho) 

In the example the high was 19.90 and low was 17.50. If I bought and low and sold at high that would be a $240 profit for today. 

My question is. Can I hold the long term option for just a couple days and then sell if there is a buyer? To me this sounds like an EASY way to make money as long as you have the funds. I don’t get the catch (besides if the option doesn’t go in your favor until expiration)

53,investing,Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)?,"I was told from a friend that this is how some of the ultra-wealthy are generating income while avoiding taxes of any kind (capital gains or income)

A quick Google shows UBS, Merrill Lynch, eTrade, and Morgan Stanley all offer some way for you to borrow at least 50% of the value of your equities for around 2% or less.

I'm guessing the flow is:

1. Have $1m-$10m in equities

2. Take an SBLOC of 50% of the value at 2%

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

4. Pay the interest back every year, keep receiving dividends, never sell any of your equities until it is time to have repaid the loan / you ran out of cash (say every 5 years), and since then your stocks have grown so you never really have less than the original number you started with equity wise

From what I understand, there are 0 taxable events on this.

Does this sound accurate or wrong?",1631740543

73,investing,New congressional draft legislation seeks to end tax efficiency of all ETFs,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/etf-industry-risks-losing-key-tax-edge-as-democrat-whets-knife

Amid the deluge of headlines in the past few days about congressional proposals to boost taxes on companies and the wealthy is one that would affect regular investors -- and potentially alter the entire U.S. fund landscape.

Draft legislation released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon on Friday **featured a repeal of a key tax advantage for the $6.8 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry.** The move was tucked in along with a series of proposals to tighten tax reporting requirements around business partnerships, and wasn’t highlighted in Wyden’s accompanying press release.

The initiative would at a stroke **end a system of deferred taxes on capital gains linked to ETFs, bringing forward the tax burden for investors of all stripes.** That will make it all the tougher to win inclusion in the final version of tax hikes that Democrats are now assembling to help pay for a social-spending package that’s been penciled in at $3.5 trillion.

“The industry will push back hard” at the proposal, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “It’s hard for me to see this getting popular support -- in large part because it’s a benefit that is universal, so all investors, large, small and in-between, that are investing taxable money benefit from ETFs’ tax efficiency.”

The measure would bring in $205 billion over a decade, according to preliminary figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It would take effect in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that, “This proposal exempts retirement accounts entirely.”

Wyden’s proposal was made before his committee delivers its draft of tax measures for inclusion in the budget-reconciliation bill that will form the bulk of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.

The effort would address an advantage for ETFs that stems from a law dating back to the Nixon administration. The law exempts so-called regulated investment companies, or RICs, from recognizing a taxable gain on assets if shareholders are paid out “in kind.” In other words, if withdrawing investors are paid in securities like stocks rather than in cash.

**ETFs are structured so that money flows in and out via facilitators known as authorized participants, and redemptions for a fund almost always take place in-kind. That means that if there are enough withdrawals, an ETF can avoid recognizing taxable gains entirely. Rather than paying a tax on a fund’s gains each year, investors usually don’t pay anything until they sell their ETF.**

“Because ETFs are pass-through vehicles, by definition every cent of the increased tax flows through directly to the shareholders -- not all of whom are filthy rich,” Jeremy I. Senderowicz at law firm Vedder Price said by email.

Some ETF managers use so-called heartbeat trades to increase the amount of withdrawals and erase all of a fund’s taxable gains. A friendly bank moves a pile of cash into a fund before almost immediately pulling it out, allowing the ETF to shed stocks that have gone up in value without incurring a taxable gain.

“This particular proposal simply applies the same rules already in place for corporations to regulated investment companies, so wealthy investors can no longer avoid all tax on their gains,” Wyden said in his statement Tuesday. “We’re only talking about the taxable accounts of the wealthiest investors.”

A summary of Wyden’s proposal mentions heartbeat transactions in particular, although he proposes to erase the entire provision that allows RICs to avoid recognizing gains. The proposal “would repeal the exception for RICs, aligning RICs with the general requirement that gain be recognized upon distribution by a corporation of built-in gain property,” the summary said.

That’s a potential industry game-changer. While ETFs tend to have several advantages over mutual funds -- like the ability to trade all day and generally lower fees -- research has shown the tax loophole is a key driver in the long-term trend of cash flowing from mutual funds into ETFs. As that has gathered pace, U.S. issuers are this year for the first time directly converting mutual fund assets into ETFs.

The final package of tax hikes, including ones on corporations and wealthy individuals, may takes weeks to develop.

“Wyden right now is coming up with his own provisions that could fit into that” final legislation, said Nathan Dean, a government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of this as something to have in his hip pocket when the Democrats start negotiating.”

The odds may be against the ETF-related legislation ever passing, Dean said. First, because so much negotiation is still ahead, and second because it would directly impact ETFs, which are very popular with consumers. However, with so much currently up for discussion, it could slip through as a smaller provision not well-understood by lawmakers, he said. 

Senderowicz thinks the legislation has a low chance of succeeding because of the potential damage to many small investors -- but he also doesn’t rule it out.

“It’s impossible to disguise the incidence of the tax increase and thus lends itself well to political attacks,” said Senderowicz. “But if it’s a choice between it and the entire reconciliation bill coming apart?”",1631732907

**However, there have been wild speculations as to how the contagion from Evergrande defaulting might affect the global markets. Could this be a Lehman Brothers v2.0?**

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China’s No.2 property developer Evergrande Group were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing.

Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country’s financial system if the company’s $305 billion of liabilities aren’t contained.

""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note bit.ly/3CbhKPt late on Tuesday.

&gt;""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.

&gt;Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

&gt;Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

&gt;""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

&gt;But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

&gt;Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

&gt;Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

&gt;In the debt market, Evergrande's Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.

&gt;Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

&gt;On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

&gt;This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

89,investing,Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?,"I’ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

 TERMINATION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES PROGRAM

This announcement is made by China Telecom Corporation Limited (the “Company”) on a voluntary basis.

We refer to the announcement of the Company dated 7 May 2021 in relation to the review decision by The New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) that the NYSE determined to delist the American Depositary Shares of the Company (the “ADSs”).

The delisting of the Company’s ADSs has taken effect on 18 May 2021. In light of the delisting, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company resolved to terminate the ADSs program (the “ADS Program”) on 9 September 2021. On the same day, the Company entered into a letter agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, as the depositary for the Company’s ADSs, for the termination of the ADS Program.

As of 9 September 2021, the number of ADSs in issue was approximately 0.813 million and the number of H shares underlying the ADSs represented approximately 0.09% of the Company’s total issued shares. The Bank of New York Mellon has given a notice to all holders of ADSs that the ADS Program will terminate on 8 December 2021 (U.S. Eastern time) (the “Termination Date”). Holders of ADSs will have the right, at least until the Termination Date, to return the ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon in exchange for H shares of the Company with each ADS returned to be exchanged into 100 H shares of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement. The Company’s H shares are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Bank of New York Mellon expects to commence the sale of H shares of the Company represented by the remaining ADSs as soon as practicable after the Termination Date, and will pay the net cash proceeds, after deducting applicable fees and expenses, to the holders of such remaining ADSs.",1631642689
30,investing,Casino Stocks Are Sizzling After Fierce Covid Downturn," 

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

31,investing,"HighGold Mining Intersects 20 g/t AuEq over 4.3m in 100m Step-out at JT Deposit, Alaska"," 

**HighGold Mining Inc. (TSX-V:HIGH, OTCQX:HGGOF)** (“**HighGold**” or the “**Compan**y”) is pleased to announce assay results for the first drill hole of the 2021 Field Season from expansion drilling at its flagship 0.75 million ounce 10.9 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) Johnson Tract polymetallic Gold Project (“Johnson Tract”, “JT” or the “Project”) in Southcentral Alaska, USA.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/)

 

Drillhole JT21-123 was designed to test along strike and down-plunge from the **JT Deposit** as a nominal 100-meter step-out from last years expansion drilling on the northeast side of the deposit (**Figure 1**). High-grade mineralization was successfully intersected in hole JT21-123, building on the success of the 2020 drill program and extending the total strike length to 600 meters.

**Drill Highlights – JT Deposit Expansion (JT21-123)**

* **13.1 g/t Au, 200 g/t Ag, 4.92% Zn, 2.04% Pb, and 0.35% Cu (20 g/t AuEq) over 4.3m including**
   * **19.0 g/t Au, 242 g/t Ag, 7.10% Zn, 2.91% Pb, and 0.50% Cu (28 g/t AuEq) over 2.8m**

“This is a great start to the 2021 drill program,” commented President and CEO Darwin Green. “Our first drill hole of the season has intersected strong precious and base metal mineralization in a large step-out from last years drilling, expanding the total strike length of JT Deposit mineralization by 15-20% to 600 meters. In addition to the excellent gold grades, the intersection includes some of the highest silver grades documented to date at the JT Deposit and is developed within a mudstone host – features often found in gold-rich VMS deposits. We are already designing follow-up holes and are excited to see how this new variation in the mineralization style at the JT Deposit develops as we continue to test at depth and along strike.” 

**Discussion of Current JT Deposit Expansion Results**

Assay results reported today include an intersection from expansion drilling at the JT Deposit from hole JT21-123 – the first drill hole completed from the 20,000-meter Johnson Tract drill program. The mineralization encountered in hole JT21-123 is hosted within a fine-grained mudstone unit (379.7 to 384.0 meters) and is similar to the ‘**VMS style**’ mineralization reported last season in hole JT20-114 (**7.8 meters at 9.8% ZnEq**) located 600 meters northeast of the JT Deposit (*See Company press release dated April 3, 2021*). The mineralization in hole JT21-123 is characterized by fine-grained disseminated sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite-pyrite within a mudstone stratigraphically overlying strong anyhydrite-altered dacite lapilli tuff, which is characteristic of the main JT Deposit. This development continues to highlight the overall exploration potential for the Project.

Location of the step-out hole in relation to the JT Deposit is presented on a longitudinal section in **Figure 1**. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

AuEq is calculated using nominal current spot metal prices of $1780/oz gold, $24/oz silver, $4.25/lb copper, $1.35/lb zinc, $1.05/lb lead and assumed recovery of 90% for all metals. True thickness for the intersection in hole JT21-123 is not well established, with a best estimate of 70% to 80% of drilled width.

**Current Initiatives and 2021 Program Update**

Three diamond drill rigs are currently operating on the Project in conjunction with a regional geological mapping and geochemical sampling program, ground-based induced polarization (“DCIP”) geophysical surveying, and a Phase I metallurgical sampling program. Assays results will be released on an ongoing basis pending review and meeting Company quality assurance-quality control protocols. An updated mineral resource estimate is planned for the JT Deposit in early 2022, following the completion and receipt of all assays from the 2021 drill program. The new resource estimate will incorporate new drilling completed in 2020 and 2021.

Over 10,000 meters of a planned 20,000 meters have been drilled to date. This includes 11 holes at JT Deposit area targets, and 15 holes at DC Prospect targets, one of several regional prospects that define a 12-km long mineralized trend at Johnson Tract. The JT Deposit expansion program includes 100-meter nominal step-outs from the known extent of mineralization along strike to the northeast and southwest, down plunge, and within the recently defined Footwall Copper Zone. For additional detail on 2021 drill targets please see Company press release dated June 23, 2021. DCIP geophysical surveying, designed to detect sulphide mineralization, is ongoing and has to date completed approximately 28-line kilometers of a planned 40-line km survey. Drilling at Johnson Tract is scheduled to continue through the end of October. Ability to complete the full 20,000 meters this season is contingent on weather and drilling conditions. Upon completion of the Johnson Tract program, drilling is expected to commence at HighGold’s Ontario gold projects.

**About the Johnson Tract Gold Project**

Johnson Tract is a poly-metallic (gold, copper, zinc, silver, lead) project located near tidewater, 125 miles (200 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, USA. The 21,000-acre district scale property includes the high-grade Johnson Tract Deposit (“JT Deposit”) and at least nine (9) other mineral prospects over a 12-kilometer strike length. HighGold acquired the Project through a lease agreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (“CIRI”), one of 12 land-based Alaska Native regional corporations created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. CIRI is owned by more than 9,100 shareholders who are primarily of Alaska Native descent.

Mineralization at Johnson Tract occurs in Jurassic-age intermediate volcaniclastic rocks and is characterized as epithermal-type with submarine volcanogenic attributes. The JT Deposit is a thick, steeply dipping silicified body (20m to 50m average true thickness) that contains a stockwork of quartz-sulphide veinlets and brecciation, cutting through and surrounded by a widespread zone of anhydrite alteration. The Footwall Copper Zone is located structurally and stratigraphically below JT Deposit and is characterized by copper-silver rich mineralization. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and to a depth of 350 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

The JT Deposit hosts an Indicated Resource of 2.14 Mt grading 10.93 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) comprised of 6.07 g/t Au, 5.8 g/t Ag, 0.57% Cu, 0.80% Pb and 5.85% Zn. The Inferred Resource of 0.58 Mt grading 7.16 g/t AuEq is comprised of 2.05 g/t Au, 8.7 g/t Ag, 0.54% Cu, 0.33% Pb, and 6.67% Zn. For additional details see NI 43-101 Technical Report titled “*Updated Technical Report for the Johnson Tract Project, Alaska*” is dated August 9, authored by Ray C. Brown, CPG, and James N. Gray, P.Geo. Gold Equivalent is based on assumed metal prices and 90% recovery for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Assumed metal prices for the Resource are US$1350/oz for gold (Au), US$16/oz for silver (Ag), US$2.80/lb for copper (Cu), US$1.00/lb for lead (Pb), and US$1.20/lb for zinc (Zn) and are based on nominal 3-year trailing averages as of April 1, 2020. Historical metallurgical testing on drill core samples has indicated that good gold and base metal recoveries and marketable concentrates can be expected.

Prior to HighGold, the Project was last explored in the mid-1990s by a mid-tier mining company that evaluated direct shipping material from Johnson to the Premier Mill near Stewart, British Columbia.

**Additional notes:**

The starting azimuth and dip (Azimuth/-Dip) for drillhole JT21-123 is 130/-62. Samples of drill core were cut by a diamond blade rock saw, with half of the cut core placed in individual sealed polyurethane bags and half placed back in the original core box for permanent storage. Sample lengths typically vary from a minimum 0.5 meter interval to a maximum 2.0 meter interval, with an average 1.0 to 1.5 meter sample length. Drill core samples are shipped by air and transport truck in sealed woven plastic bags to ALS Minerals sample preparation facility in Reno, Nevada for sample preparation and analysis. ALS Minerals operate according to the guidelines set out in ISO/IEC Guide 25. Gold is determined by fire-assay fusion of a 50 g sub-sample with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Samples that return values &gt;10 ppm gold from fire assay and AAS are determined by using fire assay and a gravimetric finish. Various metals including silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc are analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy, following multi-acid digestion. The elements copper, lead and zinc are determined by ore grade assay for samples that return values &gt;10,000 ppm by ICP analysis. Silver is determined by ore grade assay for samples that return &gt;100 ppm.

The Company has a robust QAQC program that includes the insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates.

33,investing,Is This the Right Time to Invest in Casino Stocks?," 

For some, 2020 was the worst year to be a casino investor. For others, it was the best year in a decade. The explanation is rather straightforward. Brick and Mortar casinos suffered heavy financial losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

If you owned stocks for Wynn Resorts, the Bellagio, and Las Vegas Sands, you had to cut your losses or hold onto your stocks despite their declining values. On the flip side, online casino shareholders recorded increased profits because the industry was not impacted by COVID.

## Buying Casino Stocks in 2021

While 2020 had mixed results for casino investors, 2021 is proving to be a better year for both types of investors. The fact that Macau casinos lost 79% of their stock values last year means they hold immense growth potential this year.

In the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos performed better than their Macau counterparts. No, they didn’t make higher profits compared to 2021. In fact, they suffered losses for half of 2021.

During the six months US casinos were up and running, though, they generated enough revenues to stay afloat. In 2021, these businesses have been in a recovery mode. Once in a while, they’re ordered to shut down or reduce capacity.

But generally speaking, most of these businesses have been open throughout 2021.Mobile gambling businesses, on the other hand, picked from where they left last year. From leading American brands like Penn National Gaming and DraftKings to 888 Sports and Paddy Power—online casino stocks are on an upward curve.

In fact, some land-based casinos—Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts—have already expressed their interest in buying online gambling stocks. Which stocks will they buy? No one knows.

[Go to this page](https://www.bestcasinosites.net/canada/) for an overview of the top online casinos in Canada. Check out how they work, their games, terms, bonuses, and payment options. If convinced, you could even play a few games. And if you’re more of an investor, you can buy shares from the best-performing brands.

## 5 Best Casino Stocks to Check out

Investors with high-risk appetites began bulking up gambling stocks last year. But if you’re yet to make a purchase, below is a list of five stocks to check out:

### 1. Flutter Entertainment (OTC: PDYPF)

At a price tag of $200 per share, Flutter Entertainment is a fairly expensive stock. However, it also holds incredible growth potential. Here’s why. This Irish company owns some of the biggest online gambling companies in the world:

* FanDuel
* Paddy Power
* Bet Fair
* PokerStars (The Stars Group)

FanDuel, which added 900,000 new players last year, generated 91% of the company’s US revenue in 2020. FanDuel dominates 36% of the American sports betting industry, estimated to be worth over $5 billion.

Much of Flutter’s growth potential comes from the US. And that’s not just because of FanDuel. Online gambling is increasingly becoming legal in the US. This will lead to more sales and a growing stock value for OTC: PDYPF.

DraftKings’ is FanDuel’s biggest competitor in the US. As such, the growth of FanDuel also means DraftKings is doing pretty well. Indeed, DraftKings prides in dominating 25% of the US online sport betting market share.

Some experts doubt DraftKings will live up to its potential now that brick and mortar casinos are back in operation. But there’s a high chance it will prove these critics wrong. Although Land-based casinos have a huge audience, growing statistics show more Americans are choosing mobile over in-person sports betting.

In New Jersey, for example, 80% of the $5B betting handle recorded in 2019 came from mobile bettors. This is the case for Pennsylvania, DC and a few more states. People are adopting mobile betting in droves, which could improve DraftKings’ stock price from the current $60 to $100 or more.

### 2. DraftKings

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the industry will grow by 15%. In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

All the same, what this growth means is that eSports betting websites like EEG could grow in the long term as well. Beware, though, loads of betting websites are embracing eSports betting. As such, EEG’s market share will reduce over time.

### 3. Esports Entertainment Group

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the [industry will grow by 15%](https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/). In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

### 4. Gamesys Group

Gamesys is one of the biggest gambling brands in the UK. Last year, its stock price plummeted after its brick-and-mortar casinos were shut down. But it managed to recover significantly toward the end of the year mainly due to the solid performance of its online brands.

Considering the gambling industry is projected to climb in the next five years, Gamesys can be a safe bet. It’s a high-cap brand. And as a result, there’s a high chance its stock will climb. However, it’s an expensive stock and it might not surge as much as its smaller competitors.

### 5. MGM Resorts

If you would love to own a part of Las Vegas, consider investing in one of the biggest brands in the desert: MGM Resorts. This company is always looking for investment opportunities, which is how it became the largest casino in Vegas.

Unlike some of its competitors, MGM Resorts owns an online casino. In fact, it’s constantly acquiring licenses in every state legalizing online gambling. Last year, MGM also made brave decisions by selling a significant chunk of its real estate holdings to focus on casino operations. That said, the brand’s track record and overall stocks growth show it’s a great buy for long-term speculation.

45,investing,5 gold tips for forex investments,"**Understand and constantly remind yourself that** ***emotions*** **should** ***never*** **be brought to the trading table ever!** This is one of the key rules when trading. This has been emphasised by many top traders and professional finance managers. Many fail in the forex industry because they get emotionally attached to their trades. When you bring emotions to the table, you are not making informed decisions based on facts and logic, so this increases the likelihood of losing the trade. Learn to leave your emotions at the door (so to speak); so this means not getting angry, shocked, upset, overexcited and not falling in love with any charts or currency pairs. Even though you may have favourite pairs that you enjoy trading, try your best not to get attached as they can break your heart ‘in a heartbeat’ - if you’re not careful.

**A habit that was very helpful - making** ***prediction trades*** **or paper trades (not real trades).** Helps with your mind frame on the industry because the more you do this the better you get, the more you learn and the more confident you are. When a person is confident, good things usually happen to them and in this case your trading improves and that equates to more success.

**When starting out, it’s crucial to understand that the money will not come straight away but it will eventually.** It’s easy to get carried away because of the excitement of starting this new forex journey and wanting to be profitable right away - it cannot work like that - you have to start slow and steady. One way this was achieved was to *prove* to myself that I could gain *pips* and percentages - not the money. Understanding that pips make the money, you’ll also know that if you can consistently accumulate the pips then the money will follow. Do not get greedy; learn your craft before you focus on the money.

**One important habit in forex and life in general is exercising** ***self-control*** **and having** ***patience.*** These are key factors and major characteristics that are needed to be a great trader - it’s like waiting for a bus; another setup will come in five minutes (well probably longer but you get the drift). Sitting on our hands a lot of the time is part of package.

**Do** ***tests*** **and exercises to stimulate the brain every now and then.** This is a great tactic to put you in the frame of mind of knowing that this is serious and that you need to revise, research and train for forex. An example of a test would be to set yourself 10 questions to answer weekly, almost like an exam when you were in college. This will help keep the mind fresh on key aspects of the industry.

However, when I go to buy in the demo, the only option is to leverage at 1:20. I can't just say ""Ok, put 150 in to this"" for example). 

These things lead me to believe that I've been looking in the wrong place. Looking at this link it appears that the things I'm looking at on PLUS500 are no index funds

https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/110740/where-can-i-invest-into-sp500-without-leverage

So where do I go to invest a small amount every month in to an Index fund without leverage? Do I have to walk in to my bank or can I do it through an app?

I sincerely apologise for what probably seem to you guys to be ridiculous questions, but I'm a little lost here.

50,investing,How can I open a Hedge fund in New York?,"Me and my friends are from Brazil, and we have $150k in cryptoactives. My ""manager"" gets 10%+ solid every month with our high risk altcoin investment plan. We have several interested investors.

Unfortunately, we cannot open a fund in Brazil due to compliance with legal requirements. We would need the appointment of 3 managers of large funds and at least 5 million dollars: something practically impossible for us.

I have seen through the news that it is much more feasible to open a fund in the US when you have less capital and the members are young (we are 17-19 years old).

I will be doing an exchange in New York City in January and February 2022. I plan to use this opportunity to gather information on what the methodology of this process would be. After that I intend to get a business visa and return by the end of the year to do the opening procedure.

This idea is relatively new. Recently my uncle (he is CFO and shareholder of an investment consultancy with US$300 million in custody in Brazil) explained to me the impossibility of opening in Brazil. I would really be grateful if anyone could help me with tips / references / sites / guide on how I can do this in the US. The idea is very new and I need a reference / base.",1631611392
58,investing,"If you make less than $110k and are married, you should be taking long term capital gains every year from your taxable accounts, I think?","After looking at tax brackets for long term capital gains, I believe that married couples with income of less than $110k should be capturing their gains every year until they hit $110k total income. 

For married filing jointly with a taxable income of less than $80k, the tax on long term capital gains is 0%. With the standard deduction of $24k, that means your income can be up to $104k before your would start paying taxes on long term capital gains. Add in some above the line deductions like HSA contributions, traditional 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, student loan interest, and any tuition and you can easily exceed the $110k income number that I used earlier. 

If your income is less than that amount you could sell your holdings until your realized gains reach that limit  and you would pay 0% tax on them. You could immediately rebuy them at a new cost basis and continually do this year after year until your income exceeds the limit. then when you finally sell, you would be using a much higher cost basis than if you held through all those years. 

Obviously you could do this if you were single as well, but all the amounts would be halved due to the lower tax thresholds.

Is anyone out there doing this? Is there something I'm missing? Some of my investments will reach long term status at the beginning of the year and I can't see any reason not to sell and buy them back since I'm well below the $80k taxable income limit.",1631601918

77,investing,How would I become a private investor?,"I am 18 years old and a sophomore in college (in the USA). I am a business major, as business/investing has been pretty much a passion for me since I discovered it. I love the field and enjoy it. 

I started getting into stocks when I was 16. I also did an internship at a company that summer and was able to “shadow” the owner to see what running a company is like. Learned a lot and it was interesting even though it was only a month there. Wish it could be longer, it was a different country too. 

After a year of investing and researching the stock market every single day, I decided to make the big jump and start an e-commerce store. I was still under 18 and had to use my parents behalf to start it. It was a big jump. The website and products were great, but the only issue was that I didn’t know how to drive traffic and customers that were going to make a purchase. I didn’t know how to market my products. And just because a business is visually good it doesn’t mean that the business can perform well. Starting my own business was great, I learned more in those 2 months (I know its short) than I did in my freshman year of college. 

This was the only issue, however I did learn how important every part of a business is., and how one bad part of a business can cause it to fail. I also had to learn some basic marketing stuff on my free time. 

So for the next year and a half I started to get involved in any sort of investing I can do at my age. 
Ive created business models/ideas as well on the side to safe as future reference.

Ive noticed my strengths in the business field, and I think being a private investor might be a good option in the future. Heck, I love all types of investing in general lol. Maybe I could start investing in different industries privately. 

How would I start being a private investor (starting small of course. More in startups, different industries etc)? Is this something I can right out of college or even before if I have enough capital? Do I need to be an Accredited Investor and have a better background?",1631588614

99,investing,"House Democrats propose new retirement plan rules for the rich, including contribution limits and a repeal of Roth conversions","
   House Democrats proposed several changes to retirement accounts as part of a push to make the tax code more equitable and raise money for their $3.5 trillion budget plan.
    Among them, the reforms would end “backdoor” and “mega-backdoor” Roth strategies for the wealthy and add new rules for individuals with retirement savings over $10 million.
    The legislation would also disallow IRA investments that require owners to be accredited investors.


House Democrats proposed a slew of changes to retirement accounts for the rich on Monday, part of a restructuring of the tax code tied to a $3.5 trillion budget plan.

Taken together, Democrats’ reforms aim to erode the use of retirement accounts as a perceived tax shelter for the wealthy and instead promote them as a way for low- and middle-income Americans to build a nest egg.

Most of the changes would start in 2022.

Wealthy individuals with retirement accounts exceeding $10 million would be prohibited from contributing extra savings and would have a new required minimum distribution each year, according to an outline of tax legislation unveiled Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

House Democrats propose corporate tax rate of 26.5%

The bill would also repeal so-called Roth conversions in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans for those making more than $400,000 a year. It would also prevent savers from using the “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy, regardless of income level.

Further, the legislation would prohibit individual retirement accounts from holding investments that require buyers to be accredited investors, a status generally reserved for wealthy investors.

The proposals are part of a broader theme of raising taxes on those who earn more than $400,000 a year to help pay for education, climate, paid-leave, child-care and other measures while also making the tax code more equitable.

They also follow Democrats’ outcry following a recent ProPublica report that Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, owns a Roth IRA that had grown to $5 billion in 2019, up from less than $2,000 in 1999.

“IRAs were designed to provide retirement security to middle-class families, not allow the super wealthy to avoid paying taxes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in July after a data release showing growth of “mega” IRAs.

Democrats have narrow margins within which to pass a bill, which they aim to do with a simple majority via a budget reconciliation maneuver.

Republicans remain staunchly opposed. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, framed the spending as the “greatest expansion of the welfare state in our lifetimes” during a Thursday hearing, saying that it “wastes hard-earned tax dollars.”
Contribution limits

Current law lets taxpayers make IRA contributions regardless of account size.

However, the legislation would prohibit individuals from making more contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if the total value of their combined IRA and defined-contribution plan exceeds $10 million. A defined-contribution plan is a 401(k) plan or other similar workplace savings plan.

The policy’s purpose would be “to avoid subsidizing retirement savings once account balances reach very high levels,” according to a proposal outline.

That limit would apply to single taxpayers with more than $400,000 of taxable income. The threshold would be $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $425,000 for heads of household.
RMDs for ‘mega’ IRAs

Individuals whose combined traditional IRA, Roth IRA and defined-contribution retirement accounts exceed $10 million at year’s end would have to withdraw at least 50% of the excess the following year.

Those with account totals exceeding $20 million must pull from Roth IRAs and 401(k) plans first.

These new required minimum distributions for mega IRAs would only be required for savers whose taxable income exceeds the same thresholds identified above for the contribution limits.
Backdoor Roth

There are income limits to contribute to Roth IRAs. In 2021, single taxpayers can’t add money to such accounts if their income exceeds $140,000.

But current law allows for “backdoor” contributions to Roth IRAs. That can be achieved by converting a traditional IRA or Roth 401(k) account, which don’t carry income limits. There are income limits that determine whether contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible or not.

Savers pay tax on the conversions, but their future investment growth and retirement distributions are tax-free.

The legislation would end the backdoor Roth IRA strategy by eliminating Roth conversions for both IRAs and workplace plans such as 401(k) plans.

The policy would apply at the same income thresholds listed above. It would count for distributions, transfers and contributions made in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2031.
Mega backdoor Roth

The so-called “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy uses a principle similar to that of the backdoor Roth.

The strategy lets high earners save up to $58,000 in a 401(k) plan — more than the traditional $19,500 contribution limit — using a type of after-tax 401(k) bucket. Savers then convert that savings to a Roth account, once again yielding the benefit of tax-free investment growth.

Democrats’ legislation would end the mega-backdoor Roth by prohibiting all after-tax contributions in workplace plans and prohibiting after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to a Roth account.

This policy would apply for everyone, regardless of income level.
Accredited investors

Democrats’ legislation would disallow IRA investments that require the owner to have a minimum level of assets or income, or to have completed a minimum level of education or obtained a specific license or credential.

This would apply, for example, to accredited investors seeking to buy a private investment.

IRAs with these investments would lose their IRA status — meaning they’d lose their tax benefits.

These rules would apply starting in 2022, but there’d be a two-year transition period for IRAs already holding these investments.",1631571383

83,investing,Beijing to break up Ant’s Alipay and force creation of separate loans app,"**Seems like BABA can't catch a break. The Ant valuation has dropped a lot ever since its IPO was scuttled last November. BABA has been in a downtrend since then and looks like there will be more selling this week. The bottom will be found only when the regulatory pressures on all its businesses (e-commerce, finance, cloud, etc) ease up**

Beijing wants to break up Alipay, the 1bn plus-user superapp owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and create a separate app for the company’s highly profitable loans business, in the most visible restructuring yet of the fintech giant.

Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders. Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned, according to two people familiar with the process.

“The government believes big tech’s monopoly power comes from their control of data,” said one person close to financial regulators in Beijing. “It wants to end that.”

The move may slow down Ant’s lending business, with the enormous growth of Huabei and Jiebei partly powering its planned IPO last year. The CreditTech unit, which includes the two units, overtook Ant’s main payment processing business for the first time in the first half of 2020, to account for 39 per cent of the group’s revenues.

Yes, it will be harder for Apple to collect the fee. But most Devs won’t bother since they would have to pay Apple 30% PLUS the credit card processor an additional 3-4%.

Given these demographics, long Covid is likely to cast a long shadow on our health care system and economic recovery. Source: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2109285

Comes in Ventripoint Diagnostics. $VPT is a commercial medical imaging company that enables fast and simple screening of cardiac diseases through its VMS+ 3.0 system. VMS+ 3.0 is a hardware/software system compatible with any echocardiogram that transforms 2D and 3D ultrasound images into MRI-equivalent full 3D models of the heart. 

VPT recently announced their joint venture with General Electric Healthcare to place their software on GE's ultrasound machines. Just capturing 1% of this specific market is $2,000,000,000 in sales.

To sum up, there are many positive catalysts for Ventripoint. Firstly, any investment in the company is substantially de-risked given that the product is already developed with regulatory approvals and sales are already underway.

Its current valuation of USD$50 million is also small change for large players and this may result in an attractive exit strategy if an acquisition goes through.

Compare Ventripoint against its peers - the Nasdaq-listed Nano X- Imaging Ltd. (NNOX) with a market cap of US$1.57 Billion. https://www.smallcapasia.com/5-things-to-like-about-ventripoint/ The potential is huge!

I’ve been thinking a bit about retirement this week and just for shits and giggles I went on and looked at the different allocation options I have to the fund and looked at the target date retirement fund for 2025 and on the breakdown of it and noticed that it is 50% stocks (32% US, 18% international), 37% cash, 5% bonds and 8% other…

1. The stock allocation seemed a bit high, but the more alarming part was I always thought the bond allocation would be closer to what the cash allocation is?

30,investing,What does interest rates do to bond yields? I’m not sure I understand it all.,"Ok, so if bond prices fall, the value of bond ETF’s that hold those bonds also falls. If I buy bonds I want a high yield, right? Yield is the return I’m getting on that bond. So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let’s say $6,000 discount bond price.  So my yield is ($1000/$6,000) = .1666666. 

If I bought the bond at a premium, let’s say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

So if interest rates are expected to rise due to inflation, bond prices are going to drop? Thus bond yields will go up?

And if interest rates go down, bond prices rise, and yields decrease?

50,investing,Carl Zeiss as exposure to investments in semiconductor production,"As we know the demand for semiconductors is only set to grow over the long-term. Additionally supply constraints and geopolitics has prompted new fab construction in Europe and the US. The shortage of chips for the European cars industry coupled with the fact that EV's leverage computing power far more than combustion has really lit the fire under EU governments. This coincides with the deployment of the 750 billion euro recovery fund a lot of which is earmarked for investment in ""digitization"" and technology as well as the explicit goal of EU govts to increase domestic chip production. Certainly there is a fairly unique confluence of positive factors for the chip industry in Europe. 

ASML (the worlds most advanced supplier of industrial equipment for chipmaking) has grown in value for some time now and I wonder if a lot of said factors are priced in. Its subcontractor Carl Zeiss which is among the world leaders in optics technology has also seen its stock value increase but not by as much despite being crucial for advanced litography and frankly, in my estimation, far ahead of the competition.

I'm thinking about the potential upside but what keeps me back is the fact that: 1 despite being high-value-added there is only so much potential demand for advanced optics, lasers and such and 2 the highly specialized engineering cannot be scaled up in the same way, say car or battery production can. Still I think it's a safe medium and long-term bet but the oppertunity cost of putting money in Zeiss compared to obvious growth industries like battery is unclear.

57,investing,Forward PE Estimate for SP500 will fall short over next 10 years,"Hi everyone. I want to make a simple point and have a debate about the SP500 valuation.  Basically, the big question we all have to ask ourselves is what is the longterm annualized return on the SP500 if we invest at these levels? I have seen people calculate this based on the current forward PE estimate and I believe this is highly dangerous!

Here is the common argument I see on here:

SP500 forward PE is at 22. Therefore we have a 4.5% earnings yield. Then given historical real earnings growth of the SP500 of 2%, we should see a 6.5% real return if investing at these levels. This isn't bad comparing to negative real yield offered by TIPs. And a measily nominal yield of 1.34% nominal yield of the 10yr. Therefore SP500 is fairly attractive. 

However, I don't think we should be assuming the real earnings implied by the forward PE is a reasonable starting place for this calculation. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what we see in the next couple of years, but can we really assume this will last? Current forward PE of 22 on SP500 at 4500 means we expect to see 205 in real earnings which I will argue cannot last outside of the next few years.

Instead here are what I believe to be more accurate depiction of what the true earnings will be going forward on a real, averaged level. This will determine forward annualized returns.

**Estimate 1: 2019 real earnings is 140.  (Also max real earnings of SP500 is 140).**

This isn't the most reliable estimate but it is telling. The reason that it is telling is that it is the pre-covid earnings of the SP500 and recent. Not only that but it is also the all time high real earnings for the SP500 and occurs after a period of recovery fueled by extreme debt. Now of course 2019 is backward looking so if we account using a 2% real earnings growth rate, then we get to 148 in SP500 real earnings going forward.

**Estimate 2: CAPE Ratio is 40 implying 112.5 in real earnings for 10 year average. Adjusting for earnings growth the ratio is 36.5 implying 120 in real earnings.**

Now CAPE ratio, as it is the PE ratio with E being the average of the last 10 years of inflation adjusted earnings, is somewhat backward looking. Although it does account for inflation it does not account for natural growth in earnings. If we take the historical geometric mean of 2% annualized real earnings growth and adjust CAPE for this, then the CAPE ratio is 36.5 or about 120 in real earnings. This better reflects what earnings are likely to be going forward. Personally I believe this estimate to be the most fair measurement.

**Forward PE predicts 205 in real earnings for SP500.**

This tells me one should not use the forward PE for SP500 to forecast the earnings of the SP500 for the next decade as it would be 50% above all time high earnings that occurred in 2019. It is also 70% more than 10 year averaged earnings (with an adjustment for earnings growth and inflation to make it more realistic).

So we cannot possibly expect forward PE to give us a meaningful idea of the levels we are investing in! The danger is that forward PE may convince investors they will likely earn a 6.5% long term real annualized return (say 30 years) by investing at these levels and maybe a drawdown to say a 10PE would only mean a 50% decline.

However, more realistically, investors in SP500 will likely have a 4.7% real long term annualized return say (30 years) by investing in the SP500. Also if we are to revert to a 10 CAPE this could imply a crash as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

**TL;DR**

Your long term rate of return for the SP500 at these levels will not be 10% real. It will not even by 6.5% real which using the forward PE might imply. Instead it will likely be closer to 4.7% real with the risk of a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

Now I'm not saying to hold cash, gold, crypto or whatever instead. I think stocks are the most sensible long term investment still because a 4.7% real return is still nice. However, they aren't for everyone! You will only realize this level of return in the long term and in the interim your portfolio could be down 50-75% meaning you would have a HEFTY penalty if you had to take out early. So is this hefty penalty worth it for the 5% real return? This is what we must ask.",1631297890

I'm interpreting that at this point the suppliers are crediting the company or that the clients payed in advance for the services that are about to be provided.

97,investing,Major crisis were led by property crisis.,"Urban construction, modernisation and so, is the main investment done by governments to boost the economy, because urbanisation attracts investments and cities created big consume demands. But these investments are the major forces leasing to the main crises at least since 1870.

When France economy was starting getting weak in the middle of XIX century they invested in modernising Paris is a huge scale. It workerd to attract investment and to create demand for business but eventually it lead to the late 1860s crises resulting the the famous Paris Commune. The war against Bismark's Prussia was an other way to attempt to invest the eccess of capital.

The very same strategy was the urban development in NY and other major cities in America leading and the property crisis in the midle of 1920s preciding the big economic crash.

The  american suburb development in the 1940s excluding minorities, especially the black community,  and the bored suburb middle class kids, lead the 68 protests.

After changes in the economy for a more Neoliberal strategy, giving much more power to capitalists acumulation investments in urban development became more frequent and so the cycle of crisis.

The crisis of 1973 originated in a global property market crash; it wasn't really the oil prices as mainstream economics like to suggest. The property crash happen 6 months before the oil price hike and recession was well under way by the fall.

Commercial property lead the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s in the US.

The end of Japan boom in 1990 corresponded to a collapse of land prices.

Nationalisation of Swedish banking system in 1992 because of eccess in property markets.

One of the teiggers for the collapse in East and South East Asia in 1997-98 was the eccessive urban development in Thailand.

Since urbain development have been intensified in the past 20 years I assume that keeping an eye on the property market is a good idea as a sinal for major crisis approaching.

The greater the share of property markets in GDP, the more significant the connection between financing and investment in the built environment becomes a major source of macro crisis.

In the US where housing mortgage was equivalent of 40% of GDP it mostly certainly generated  a crisis in 2007-09.",1631271198
98,investing,The demand for copper against the copper supply,"Seeing the current situation, I strongly believe that the demand for copper will just keep on rising, so the prices will also rise unless we find more copper or some other economic alternative.

This brings me to the question about the possibility of the supply to meet the demand. Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.

There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.

A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.

Among them is Three Valley Copper ([TVC.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/)), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity until Papomono Masivo is in full production.

As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase.",1631270936

My financial advisor (a good friend, but I don't pay him for advice) suggests I move about half of what I have in that asset class into several large cap funds to lock in some gain and provide some stability against interest rate increase and inflation fears.

I have plenty of faith in the guy, he would never intentionally lead me wrong (since he doesn't get any money for this advice), but it got me thinking about whether his advice is based on sound reasoning.

Would moving from small caps to large caps be a hedge against interest rate increases and inflation? If so, it seems like a no brainer. Also, if true, is that why small cap indexes have mostly traded sideways in the last 6 months?",1631200023
86,investing,Can someone please explain futures rollovers,"Hello,

Like the title says, I am curious about how the futures rollovers work particularly in the context of ES and NQ.

I see it appears that contracts for the next quarter begin trading today (9/9/21) for Dec expiry contracts. But that doesn't mean the contracts expiring next week have stopped trading. When does the ""roll"" for trading normally compete for Sept contracts? A week before expiry (ie tomorrow, Friday), or Wednesday before expiry..?

Were contracts for Dec and further forward expiry already trading prior to today or no?

Is the typical effect on the price as the contract expiration nears convergence to spot? Is it not the case that everyone who does not intend to actually take delivery will effectively begin to evaporate from the market as the expiration date nears? What's the last day for which those who do not intend to take delivery actively trade?(assuming T-1 to expiry but not sure)

Sorry if these are overly simplistic questions I don't have experience with futures contracts and any answers would be helpful and appreciated. Thank you.",1631199039

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years, with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?
* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

18,investing,How I made more than 10% annual profit using microloans," 

Hi everyone!

I would like to tell you about my experience of investing in P2P lending platforms.

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

2019 was the year of the lowest interest rates on deposits in the EU- fluctuated around 0.5-1% per annum, and this has been around for more than 2 years.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

28,investing,RSUs and Taxes - What's the Math?,"So, using smart asset, I figured that my marginal tax rate is around 35%. If I sell $10k worth of RSUs right at the vest, $2.2k (22%) should have already withheld for me at the vest. My actual tax responsibility was $3.5k (35%). So this means that I would need to withhold $1.3k of what I sold to pay taxes at tax season.

If my usual tax return is about $1k, I'd now owe $300.

So on that sale of $10k, I actually keep $8.7k. If I didn't sell, I'd still be responsible for paying the $1.3k.

Are my math and reasoning correct here?

I.e., I'd need to always sell an extra 13% of my shares to pay for taxes at vest; I keep 87% of what I sell.",1631175942

The Chinese government has temporarily suspended approval for all new online games in the country, dealing a fresh blow to the video gaming businesses of industry giants Tencent Holdings and NetEase, as Beijing steps up measures to tackle gaming addiction among young people, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
That decision was revealed during a meeting on Wednesday called by Chinese authorities, led by the publicity department of the Chinese Communist Party and gaming watchdog the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), to discuss with representatives from Tencent and NetEase how they will implement Beijing’s new restrictions on video gaming for minors, according to a person briefed on the matter, but declined to be named because the information is private.

35,investing,KO Warrants w/o End Date vs. Regular Options,"I know this is more a trading/gambling topic than investing, but humor me please.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

(In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

For example, a KO warrant on the S&amp;P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2% (note that this is exponential (flattening, not parabolic) because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (KO) for another (Time decay / No volatility), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

My main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.

I am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. 

I back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.

91,investing,Extending 'Islamic Finance' to Crypto is a pretty good investment," Exhibiting in London today and featured on CoinMarketCap; if you haven't been introduced to DFL- Supercup sponsor Caizcoin just yet, it's high time to learn it's merits. It's big, it's bold and it's a revolution for many.

I've held back from posting about this currency up until now mainly due to two reasons:

* I don't believe in posting the ""merits"" of something until I am confident enough to invest in it myself
* In the Crypto-sphere you need approach new projects with caution lest they turn out to be over-hyped, or worse, scams

Yet, I have never felt so comfortable writing about a project as I do this one, with both those reasons flung out the window - and soon you will see why this is a great opportunity present.

### What is Caizcoin?

Access the whitepaper [here](https://member.caizcoin.com/white-paper).

Caizcoin's ""developer team collaborated closely with worldwide scholars, famous economists, business professionals, and IT experts to create Caizchain, an innovative blockchain"" (CMC, 2021). It features:

* low transaction fees,
* a distributed ledger,
* a top-notch consensus algorithm,
* and transaction speeds that outperform all current blockchains
* user-intuitive interface,
* extensively tested its API on different factors to assure high-quality performance and scalability

&amp;#x200B;

The added kick? It appeals to a vast population of Muslims who are in pursuit of 'Islamic Compliant Finance' for their investments- notably, gamble and interest free.

It is estimated that 20 to 30% of Muslim majority countries, from the Middle East and South Asia exclusively participate in 'Islamic finance' as a pose to conventional financial products which often have attached mechanisms of interest. The market for this project is certainly there.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why CAIZ?

The Crypto industry is volatile - that's no secret - but throw in a mix of malicious actors and rug-pulls, there is further dissuasion in participating or adopting. Notably however, on CoinMarketCap, the Caizcoin project is designed in a way to:

&gt;*...to create a moral platform will be highly advantageous to small investors looking for secure investments. The Caiz team has stated on several occasions that their creative financial solution will assist the Muslim crypto community in multiplying the returns on their investments and that it will be beneficial to everybody, regardless of their background or religious affiliation. - CMC, 2021*

What is key to note here is that the **project seeks to extend itself to all realms of society,** and what is NOT is a project exclusively for Muslims. That is it's focal point but the investment opportunity is there for all individuals regardless of religion or nationality.

99,investing,"ASX: RBL. Redbubble, the next Etsy","Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4

The company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. 

Here are some of their key selling points. 

Their business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back

They have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. 

The valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. 

I want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. 

Etsy Revenue (USD)

2015 - 273M 
2016 - 364M
2017 - 441M
2018 - 603M
2019 - 818M
2020 - 1.7B

Redbubble Revenue (AUD). 

2019 - 306M
2020 - 416M
2021 - 657M
2024 - 1.5B Target

Etsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. 

Mostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. 

The Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",1631120325
4,investing,The Original Bitcoin Protocol: What Is It and Why Does It Matter? [MNP Report],"[MNP](https://www.mnp.ca/en/insights/directory/the-original-bitcoin-protocol-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter)

**Synopsis**

As Bitcoin creates waves, our team steps back to examine the origins of the cryptocurrency. Read our whitepaper to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology and it’s applicability.

In the last 10 years, concepts like blockchain and digital currencies have moved from small online communities to being supported by some of the world’s largest firms. These concepts and ideas were best presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of Bitcoin. With the rise in popularity, and the different offerings, MNP found it necessary to investigate what Bitcoin implementation best fits Nakamoto’s original vision.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” sets the stage for our analysis. Nakamoto’s whitepaper, emails, forum posts, and original source code define the protocol — the rule set for Bitcoin as a data network — and the key elements that make Bitcoin a functional technology. Along with the whitepaper, we reviewed the publicly available emails, forum posts, and original code left by Nakamoto. We used these source materials to determine what Nakamoto’s original purpose for Bitcoin was – a global electronic cash system (that works peer-to-peer), while also laying the foundation for a network that can support more advanced data applications.

Using the sources mentioned above, we developed an assessment framework and related criteria assessing the relevance of the Bitcoin scripting language (including OpCodes incorporated in it), protocol elements, and capabilities in current implementations — Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) against Nakamoto’s original vision.

Our findings indicate that BSV is most representative of Nakamoto’s original intention and design for Bitcoin. One key factor is because the BSV blockchain demonstrates the ability to scale to support significant volumes of transactions in a timely manner for macro-payments and even micropayments, resulting from BSV’s “Genesis” hard fork in February 2020. This removed any arbitrary cap on block size and allows the BSV blockchain and transaction capacity to grow unbounded, while also removing state restrictions limits and improving the code base to allow for unbounded scaling. In addition, the Genesis hard fork restored key aspects of the original functionality of Bitcoin script, the programming language used within the Bitcoin protocol. In our whitepaper, we also identify what technology capabilities can be enabled once Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin has been fully realized.

A general outline of report is as follows:

* The Bitcoin Whitepaper
* Nakamoto’s known Forum Posts, Emails
* The Original Bitcoin Protocol
   * Capabilities
   * Critical components
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Implementation attributes
* Comparison of current Bitcoin implementations to Nakamoto’s original vision
* Impact of Nakamoto’s vision once fully realized.

9,investing,Six dividend stocks with great ratings and strong fundamentals: worth consideration?,"

Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your  attention this week. They were selected using a couple of criteria –  most of them heavily rely an the company’s fundamentals; the analysts  recommendations are only provided as a kind of support for the  hand-picked names. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.**  The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to  outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus  recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better  than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is  above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

&amp;#x200B;

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4

**Note**: Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post as well as [HERE](https://www.investing-scientist.com/research/top-stocks-to-buy-a-consensus-strategy/).             

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to  consider the following selling conditions (at least one of them should  be satisfied):

* price is higher or close to target
* profit is in range 20% – 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is changed to Sell
* Weiss Ratings recommendation is changed to Sell
* Yahoo Finance recommendation is changed to Sell

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [t](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean)heir website:

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish  case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this  stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

10,investing,Looking to build a 401K out of Capital Group American Funds :(,"Hi! Vanguard index holder here. My girlfriend's new job offered a 401K with a 3% contribution match for Capital Group: American Funds. However, these front load fees and expense ratios are horrendous.  Class-A shares with a sales charge of 5.75% WOW. I'm tasked with building her a portfolio with aggressive risk and 100% equities. She's 28 and this won't be her forever job and we plan to roll over the IRA to Vanguard when she leaves.  


How do I pick the lesser of evils? None of these funds seem to track the S&amp;P 500. All funds seem to be heavily weighted with front loads and minimal returns compared to my (managed) Vanguard portfolio. I want to set her up for success but it's hard to do so when this is the only option her employer offers. Any suggestions on how to keep her portfolio fees low and based in American equities? I feel a bit out of my depth here. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1631112908
15,investing,How does investing in a company actually impact the company itself?,"This is basic I know but I can't really put my finger on why we invest other than hoping people pay more for it later. My understanding is that a company cashes out when they IPO, they sell some shares on the public market and that's their profit to use as they choose. And then potentially they keep some shares private and if that grows, they can sell those shares as well (or issue new ones from thin air). But other than that, after the IPO, it's mostly just other people changing hands of shares- why would a company care what it's stock price / valuation is?",1631110628
18,investing,Need some advice on tax lot stock sale methods," 

On TDA you can assign any sale of stock to a specific purchase in the past. This enables one to manage which shares you are selling at any given time, as opposed to having the FIFO method execute your trade by default. First in first out (for those unaware). There are other methods such as LIFO (last in last out), High cost first out, low cost first out, etc....

I have been averaging into Draftkings as a long term position, but have found that I also enjoy swing trading the stock due to the fact that I have been holding it and have become rather familiar with its movements/patterns. I purchased a few extra shares back in May around $42-$43 for the sake of reselling sometime in the near future around 60. The plan worked as expected and I sold a handful of shares yesterday for around 63.50...TDA requires the user to log in the following day to adjust the tax lot method or to assign a sale to a specific purchase. The stock does not settle for a couple days and this can be done anytime prior to settlement after the day the stock was sold. So...With that being said. This is my question...I notice I have shares from back in March of this year as well with a higher average of around $60. I have my other shares from May and they have an average of $43. My main position was purchased awhile ago (last year), and is averaged around 50 with shares purchased all over the place. I guess I am wondering if it would be wise to sell the shares purchased at $60 back in March instead - I would barely be breaking even on them, locking in next to no profit, but would inadvertently lower my cost basis and would leave the profit I could have taken on the table. This is all for the sake of having those shares for 1+ years and being able to hold them comfortably without having to risk losing any of my initial investment/capital...Or would it be wiser to take the profit I can take off of the shares purchased in May at $40 and simply keep the others until the cost rises. I guess I feel like delaying the profit taking until the shares have matured in my portfolio for a year or more would be wise so I am not paying as much tax? If i take profit now I pay the tax on it. If I sell my higher cost shares and just barely break even (nothing to pay tax on here). This enables me to sell the other shares with a lower cost basis (and therefor a higher likelihood of being profitable) later on without having to be taxed on the profit. Sorry for the rant but does this makes sense?",1631109333

# THE ONLINE BETTING industry 

The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023—growing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

# DraftKings

DraftKings is a *sports betting*, *daily fantasy sports contest*, and an *iGaming* operator.

In total, DraftKings now operates sportsbooks in **14 states** and averages **1.5 million monthly unique paying customers** across its online sportsbooks, iGaming, and daily fantasy offerings.

# Financials

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

Another positive point in DraftKings's favor is the amount of cash the company has gathered since 2018. The company currently has $2.65 billion in cash, which compared to last year's results - $1.24 billion, is a 113% change.

28,investing,Why 'Common Prosperity’ Has China’s Billionaires Running for Cover,"[https://time.com/6095560/china-common-prosperity/](https://time.com/6095560/china-common-prosperity/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a sign of how far China’s leaders  have drifted from their revolutionary roots, the biggest shock gripping  the country today is that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might  actually be socialist after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shakeup  centers on the phrase “common prosperity.” It was first introduced by  revolutionary leader Mao Zedong but has now been taken up as the  defining mantra of a new era as imagined by current strongman President  Xi Jinping.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an Aug. 17 speech to the CCP’s  Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs—his first since the  secretive, annual summer leadership conclave at the seaside town of  Beidaihe—Xi [declared](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm)  that “Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a  key feature of Chinese-style modernization.” He used the phrase 15 times  in total in his address and it’s become a refrain ever since.  
&gt;  
&gt;[According](http://politics.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2021/0817/c1024-32197305.html) to the official *People’s Daily*,  the goal is to build a more egalitarian China by “expanding the  proportion of middle-income groups, increasing the incomes of low-income  groups, reasonably adjusting high incomes \[and\] banning illegal  incomes.” Nobody doubts that the CCP would also like to leverage common  prosperity to reassert its authority over China’s high-fliers.   
&gt;  
&gt;“These  billionaires and tech companies are very risky to the CCP because they  are seen as an alternative form of social and political power,” says  David Moser, associate dean of the Yenching Academy at Peking  University.

&gt;  
&gt;In response, skittish  investors have started dumping their stock. Up to $1 trillion has been  wiped off the valuation of Chinese firms since February, after  regulators began targeting electronic payment providers, real estate  developers, private tuition companies (a vast, $120 billion industry in  education-hungry China) and the gaming sector. The latter—a giant and  highly lucrative market generating $44 billion in earnings last year—is  now reeling from new directives banning children from playing more than  three hours of online games a week.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the  biggest socio-economic change since reformist leader Deng Xiaoping  unleashed market forces in the late 1970s. In words that have since  become infamous, Deng propelled the country’s export-driven resurgence  with the exhortation: “Let some people get rich first.” Many forget that  he went on to say that those allowed to achieve wealth would be  expected to “lead other regions and people to gradually achieve common  prosperity.” His successors now look poised to make good on the bargain.

&gt;  
&gt;A senior CCP official [said last month](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3146438/chinas-common-prosperity-push-does-not-mean-killing-rich)  that “common prosperity” does not mean “killing the rich to help the  poor.” But rumors are swirling that Beijing may bring in property,  inheritance, and capital gains taxes to level the playing field in a  society where the top 1% now control 31% of wealth, according to Credit  Suisse—up from 21% two decades ago. The preferential 10% tax rate  enjoyed by internet companies is also expected to be rolled back in  favor of the standard 25% corporate rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Xi is  saying, ‘Hey, I found the magic sauce,'” explains Sung Wen-Ti, a  scholar specializing in the CCP leadership at the Australian National  University. “‘I’m going to continue to use this socialist market economy  to encourage economic growth, while redistributing wealth in a way that  doesn’t lead us back to the Mao Zedong days of poverty.’”

&gt;  
&gt;The meaning of common prosperity  
&gt;  
&gt;In July, [to mark the CCP’s centenary](https://time.com/6077358/china-communist-party-centenary-xi-jinping/),  Xi announced that the goal of building “a moderately prosperous society  in all respects” was complete, having already declared [absolute poverty eradicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622#:~:text=Chinese%20President%20Xi%20Jinping%20says,been%20lifted%20out%20of%20poverty.).  By 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, the goal is to “build a  modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,  culturally advanced and harmonious.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course,  “democratic” means different things in China than it does in the West,  but there’s no doubt that the goal of a “socialist country” is more  important to Xi than it was to his immediate predecessors. So far,  celebrities who flaunt their wealth and welch on taxes have found  themselves abruptly taken off the Chinese internet. Officials have also [announced](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008371/beijings-top-teachers-will-rotate-shifts-across-schools)  the ramping up of a scheme to rotate the best teachers among different  schools in order to equalize education standards. Ride-hailing firm Didi  and e-commerce platform JD.com have meanwhile moved to establish trade  unions for their staff, who until now have typically been employed  casually via third-party contractors, receiving paltry benefits. But the  central government has offered little specific guidance as to what  socialism and common prosperity mean in practice.   
&gt;  
&gt;The  vagueness mirrors an anti-corruption drive started by Xi in 2012.  Instead of new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and  accountability, that purge instead borrowed from the ancient Chinese  tactic of “kill a chicken to scare the monkeys,” says Moser—making an  example of [1.5 million officials](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/china-punishes-more-than-1-5-million-officials-for-corruption/50000262-3412841), a comparatively small number, to send a clear message to all 90 million apparatchiks that graft was no longer tolerated.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is the context in which China’s wealthiest have been left to interpret  the implications of common prosperity for themselves. Unsurprisingly,  they have been throwing money at the problem, pouring billions into  charitable foundations as a gesture of appeasement.

&gt;On Thursday, Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba [pledged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/alibaba-pledges-15-5-billion-to-xi-s-common-prosperity-drive?sref=KQ64K3tR&amp;mc_cid=4a3df73e6c&amp;mc_eid=1f68a91ab9)  100 billion renminbi ($15.5 billion) to fund common prosperity  initiatives until 2025. That came on top of an earlier pledge of 100  billion renminbi from Tencent, and 10 billion renminbi from bosses at  each of Pinduoduo, Xiaomi and Meituan, for various social projects.  Alibaba had already been in the spotlight after regulators fined the  firm $2.8 billion and nixed the $37 billion IPO of its fintech arm, Ant  Group, which was subsequently ordered to restructure. Notably, the  firm—along with several of China’s most profitable corporations—is based  in Zhejiang province, chosen as “a demonstration zone for achieving  common prosperity,” [according](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/10/c_1310001320.htm) to the official Xinhua news agency.

&gt;“Xi  doesn’t want to be seen as someone who’s in league with these giant  tech companies and billionaires, so he’s cracking down on them,” says  Moser. “It’s a populist move so ordinary people feel the CCP is on their  side.”   
&gt;  
&gt;Reading the political winds, many of  China’s most famous tycoons have quietly stepped back from boardroom  positions in recent weeks to take roles with a social focus.

A debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.,"[https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-bonds-suspended-prices-slump-2021-09-06/](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-bonds-suspended-prices-slump-2021-09-06/)

&gt;SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group [**(3333.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/3333.HK) slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher. Bonds issued before that date - including Evergrande's July 2022 bond - need only be rated AA or higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) downgraded Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Thursday, and placed the company and its bonds on a watchlist for further downgrades.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday, China Securities Depository and Clearing Co. (CSDC) reduced the ""conversion ratio"" of the July 2022 bond to zero, effective Sept. 7. Other Evergrande bonds were not included in CSDC's table of conversion ratios on Friday as they no longer qualified for inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The conversion ratio determines leverage limits for repo financing given a specific bond pledged as collateral. CSDC is owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.  
&gt;  
&gt;A director at a local brokerage said that the reduction in the conversion ratio was a ""grey rhino"" - a highly obvious yet ignored threat. ""It was bound to happen.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Evergrande declined to comment. But in a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, it acknowledged the impact of the rating downgrade on the bonds' use as pledged repo collateral. It said the bonds had previously been deemed appropriate only for qualified institutional investors, and the downgrade had no impact on investor suitability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worries surrounding Evergrande, which has been scrambling to raise funds to pay lenders and suppliers, have grown into broader concerns that a debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.",1631094032

Third quarter of fiscal 2022:

Total revenues are expected to be $177.0 to $178.0 million.

Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP income from operations to GAAP loss from operations, or non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated to GAAP net loss per share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated because certain items excluded from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, the adjustment attributable to non-controlling interests, and related tax effects, including non-recurring income tax adjustments, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. In addition, the effect of the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the company's offerings of convertible notes in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these items may be significant.

32,investing,The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect the country,"Just last month, Guillermo Lasso, the president of Ecuador, issued Decree 151 which focuses on a new mining policy, strengthening the government’s support towards mining as a key driver of the economy.

According to this [article](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in-ecuador-2021-08-09), “The decree lays out a clear action plan and timeframe that has a primary objective of developing an efficient, environmentally and socially responsible mining industry in Ecuador, to promote national and foreign investment and to implement the best practices for the exploitation of these resources.”

To be honest, I am not surprised by this knowing how supportive the president is when it comes to bringing in more investors to the country. He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.

Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resources’ ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/)) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. They have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.

SolGold ([SOLG.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/)), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. 

But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuador’s economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.",1631017311

Long story short,I am taken away by how much euphoria is currently here in the market.I haven’t even been in the market for a year and I have seen people in my circle turn into financial advisors who one year ago had zero to no knowledge of the markets. 
People seem to make banks on shit and meme coins with zero to no basic knowledge of how even the blockchain works.My tiktok news feed is full of people giving financial advise on useless projects.
People are selling digital jpeg images for hundreds of thousands.
Literally yesterday an unknown dev group made like 2 million dollors selling Panda NFTs to their discord group all while with zero verification of their background.

It just doesn’t feel right,Australia has been locked down for 200 plus days in last two years,hundreds of businesses have gone down while market keeps on making record highs.

Here is the meat and potatoes of the law:

&gt;*Art. 1.* The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is mentioned in the previous paragraph does not hinder the application of the Monetary Integration law.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 2.* The exchange rate between bitcoin and the United States dollar, subsequently USD, will be freely established by the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 3.* Prices may be expressed in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 4.* Tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 5.* Exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax, just like any legal tender.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 6.* For accounting purposes, the USD will be used as the reference currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Art. 7.*** **Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 8.* Without prejudice to the actions of the private sector, the State shall provide alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish. Furthermore, the State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.

This isn't just making Bitcoin legal tender as some publicity stunt/gimmick, it's full on requiring that ""every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment"" as mentioned in Article #7. 

This is a bold move for El Salvador and a big milestone for Bitcoin. How do you think this will work out for El Salvador over the coming years? Will other countries follow?

75,investing,After Covid-19: Former Google Taiwan Director Foresees Super-Unicorn Startups,"As COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the globe, putting countless businesses on the brink of collapse, it has also given birth to new business opportunities oriented to remote working. In fact, the pandemic-driven “Work-From-Home” economy has led to a growing number of unicorns – startups with valuations above $1 billion. According to CB Insights, in the first half of 2021 alone, 203 unicorns have emerged worldwide. 

As the total number of these unicorns has tipped to above 700 around the world, Taiwan is mooted to be one of those locations with a high potential to pump out world-class unicorns. Speaking at Connect 2021 (Link in Chinese), a leading Taiwanese tech forum co-organized by TechTaiwan, Google Taiwan’s former director Dr. Lee-Feng Chien offered his insight on Taiwan’s startup and investment environment, outlining the challenges faced by Taiwanese startups and the country’s significance to the global investment community. 

“Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy.”

At the moment, Taiwan already has three unicorns. The most prominent among them is Gogoro, a leading e-bike manufacturer that has been expanding its presence in the US, Europe and India. Another unicorn is 91APP, a software company that facilitates small merchants to launch e-commerce apps. The third unicorn, Appier, is an AI software company founded in 2012, counting among its investors SoftBank Group and Temasek Holding, and has recently gone public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising  US$130 million. In fact, Appier is the first Taiwanese company to be listed in Japan since 1998.

“The success of 91APP signifies that Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy, willing to give it a higher valuation,” observed Chien who, in his time as Google Taiwan’s director, oversaw its foundation from scratch, and eventually made it Google’s largest hardware R&amp;D hub outside of the US. By introducing three data centers, Google also laid the foundation of Taiwan’s data economy. 

“Appier’s listing means that Taiwanese startups have the capability to make it abroad,” Chien commented, expressing his optimism toward Taiwanese startup scene’s recent developments. According to the Google veteran, if more startups can expand beyond Taiwan as Appier has done before, it will be a boost to Taiwan’s digital economy. Constrained by the size of real economy though, startups in the digital economy sector have so far accounted little in Taiwan’s GDP. 

The rise of super-unicorn startups

The wave of digital transformation ushered in by the pandemic, however, is regarded by Chien as the opportunity of the decade for Taiwanese startups. He noted that COVID-19 altered the traditionally conservative investment strategy of private equity funds. As investment returns dropped, private equity funds have increasingly moved into venture capital investments. 

This latest development is simultaneously a challenge and a chance to Taiwan’s startup landscape: while it pushes unicorn startups to the forefront of post-pandemic global economic revival by funnelling in the surplus in the capital market, creating so-called “super-unicorns” valued above US$10 billion in the process, it also diverts investments away from early-stage startups. 

“It is the best time to fundraise for startups, but not necessarily for launching them,” Chien observed. Under these circumstances, he pointed out that in addition to the home market, Taiwanese startups would have to secure at least one overseas market , just like Appier did, to attract the global capital market. The internet-based digital world, he observed, could lower the threshold with its borderless nature, and Chien considered it a must for Taiwanese unicorns to engage with this platform to expand its horizon. 

However, Chien also set his sight beyond digital economy, considering its growth peak to be over and competition already too fierce. Instead, he identified space, especially the satellite industry, to be the likelier sectors from which the next unicorns will emerge.",1630980145

13D Forms are also one of the core steps before announcing interest to acquire the company (could be amicable or hostile. Yet to see).  Lastly the stock just hit it downside resistance.

There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

1 dollar/unit would give #NEON 173$ per share - closed yesterday @ 5,17

How is this possible and what are the odds? 

Neonode owns the patent to the swipe technology and launched the first touchscreen phone in 2002.

The phone had small success at the time and the company changed focus.

In the great patent war between #AAPL and #SMSN 2016 Samsung overturned a huge verdict based on patent invalidity.

From the ruling: Samsung presented two prior art references, the NeoNode N1 Quickstart Guide (“Neonode”) from 2004 and a video and paper by Plaisant that were presented at a computer-human-interactivity conference in 1992. “We reverse the judgment of infringement and no invalidity because the asserted claim of the ’721 patent would have been obvious in light of Neonode and Plaisant.

New management in Neonode contacted IP specialists Aequitas in 2019 to se if they had a case against Apple and Samsung. In 2020 they filed suit for IP Infringment on patent 993 and 879

Samsung and Apple joined suit and challanged the patent in sept 2020 in IPR - this process will either nullify the patent or give the Neonode side a huge win.

They used the same tacticts as samsung aginst apple - Prior art in other patents.

The IPR Board agreed on one patent 993 - the Patent is up for discussion. 879 stands! To be made unvalid on grounds of earlier patents A/S argues:
Combination of Hisatomi / Ren or Hansen / Gillespie

Hisatomi 2002-02-20
Ren 2000/09
Hansen 1998-10-13

Neonode have invention date 2002-12-19.It turns out have Neon had an ace up their sleeve.

Yesterday Neonode filed for discovery in Sweden and questioning of the inventor Magnus Goertz.

They searched for the originals of 3 documents already in their posseion all proving the invention took place around May 2001. This kills Apple/Samsungs prior art argument and makes the Patent stand on merit.

And for the trial and Jury in texas they want another document:
The signed licensdeal with samsung from 2005 that samsung never paid.All documentation from discussion about licensing with APPLE from 2005-2010
These documents will prove the value of the technology in 2005 - probably higher then 1 $ per unit?

They will also prove without doubt that Apple and Samsung knew about the infringment

IF IPR stands their will be a Jury trial in Texas for Judge Allan albright or settlement

How do you think a Jury would react to the licensing deal?

Or samsungs defence against apple that the patent is owned på Neonode and NOT paying them a cent?

The optics of this case is spectacular and the risk reward extreme.Neonode is a company now producing touchless touch for elevators and kiosks. It is just ramping up after corona and probably will turn from loss to profit in 2022. The client list include NEC and Schindler.

- Supportive central banks with large debts that might make it favorable to keep interest rates lower for longer. Perhaps the beginning of modern monetary theory playing out
- Information Age where market participants have their finger in the pulse of the markets more than ever. Could lead to faster mini market cycles followed by fewer and farther in between large long lasting drops. Participants acutely aware of opportunity that arises from large dips historically

I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

	From this categorization we can see that the out of my narrowed down 91 ETFs from the original 140ish, it is a very well diversified portfolio of ETFs and represent many sectors in the global economy except for the energy sector which, besides new and renewable energy industries, isn’t poised for growth in the long term.

I may do a second part to this where analyze each ETF in each industry or in each ETF type more thoroughly especially for the categories labeled “(broad)” and may give my own rating on ETFs I find interesting since some of the large cap, dividend, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P are doing strategies such as futures contracts or covered calls which differ from the standard equity etf found in these sectors.

After this second part I will or someone would If they like to create a final comparison between the final narrowed down portfolio and the benchmark category I created.

74,investing,How do angel investors in non-tech companies (like Shark Tank) get a return on their investment?,"Investors in tech startups tend to prefer in companies with a hope of an exit or an IPO. And when that happens, the investor can hope to sell of his stock.

But what about non-tech angel investors, like those in the Shark Tank? A business for selling salsa online or a franchise for sushi restaurants are not likely to have an exit or an IPO. So how do the investors ever get their money back? I can understand the equity may appreciate as the business grows, but how and and when will it ever materialize into cash?

Do they at some point start collecting a share of the profits per their equity stake? Cause most of these business are very reluctant to take money out of the business since they want to reinvest and grow.",1630879284
81,investing,Where to safely invest student loans?,"Hey guys, apologies if this question has been asked a million times already.

I've received about 5k CAD in student loans that has to last me until January of 2022, or longer if I don't end up needing to spend it.

I want to put it into something relatively safe. Originally I thought I'd just keep it as 'cash' in an account, but I know that's basically a cardinal sin. 

I'm looking for recommendations on what you would do if you had 5k that you wanted to safely and comfortably invest over the next 4+ months. My mind is going to something like VFV or similar, but I am open to any and all suggestions.

85,investing,Habits for value investors. This is how I spot undervalued stocks.,"Here is the link to the full article. https://theinvestordash.com/blogs/required-investing-skills-explained-simply/behaviors-of-a-multi-millionaire

TLDR; how to find undervalued stocks by comparing the 11 sectors and small, medium and large market cap companies. 

First I have a yahoo finance chart that tracks the baseline s&amp;p 500 and then inside of that I create 11 more lines inside of that that track the different sectors. This lets you see if money is flowing from tech into the utility sector. 

That happened to me early this year. It helped me spot it before it came out in the news! I didn’t shift my money from my tech stocks to utilities because I wanted to hold. But I understood what was going on before most people and didn’t stress it. 

Also the article breaks down why comparing the s&amp;p small, medium and large caps will allow you to see that right now the large and mid cap s&amp;p aren’t undervalued. The s&amp;p 600 small cap is showing me that there may be an opportunity for solid gains.

So I’ve been digging through that and have found some solid companies that I e invested into recently and am looking for some solid gains. 

Let me know if there are any questions about the full article here and I’ll answer anything here as well. 

Good luck trading!",1630872805
96,investing,Am I wrong for chasing dividends in my scenario?,"I am 34 and married.  Combined we make $140k.  We have a 1 year old entering daycare and another kid on the way.  Daycare is $1000+ per kid, if you are unaware.  

We currently take $100/week out of our paycheck to invest in stocks.  Realistically, we won’t increase this for at least 5 years, with daycare costing what it does.  It’s possible we will have to reduce it.  

I have approximately $28k across about a dozen stocks at the moment.  All pay at least a 3% dividend and IMO have limited downside in the long term.  Dividends pay me about $1375 per year at this point.  

My thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.  It’s nice knowing that even if I have to reduce contributions to the brokerage account from our paychecks, I will still be generating some money to invest further with.

53,investing,"Company acquiring another one, offers ""notes"" instead of stock - how does that translate into the real world?","Hi all,

The company I work for was acquired by a private equity firm (PEF) - they went from a public company (shares was on the stock market) but they were all bought by the PEF.

Now a larger software based company (LSBC) has acquired them from the PEF - the LSBC isn't offering the staff shares as part of their benefits program as they own the entirety of the shares.

However, they are offering ""notes"" (and no, I don't know what that means) which I think might be a way to ""own"" shares whilst the company remains private, i.e. internally traded shares (?)

As you can tell, I have no idea what that means or how it works.

My question is, if the company grows massively and I own these so-called ""notes"" - what does that mean in terms of monetary value?

As sort of attempts to explain this would be appreciated.

Thanks

70,investing,Margin stock purchases using non-margin buying power,"Can anyone enlighten me on the voodoo that happens after the account rebalances from a stock purchase in a margin account? This is through Fidelity. Before the trade I had $32,000 margin buying power with about $11,000 non margin buying power on Friday. I made a purchase for about $8600 worth of stock X shares. Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It’s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn’t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account. I understand the stock is volatile but it doesn’t make sense to me especially since I used non-margin buying power for the trade. Thank you!",1630785190

90,investing,2021 has been unprecedented and changed investing forever.. how do you adapt in 2022?,"Although everyone has sort've silently moved on, AMC is still trading steady at $45. (\~500% gain from last year) GameStop is sitting steady at $200. (\~2000% gain). Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.

""Value"" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. 

Which poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially growth stocks?

Everything Buffett and others eschew has essentially been thrown at the window. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto ""growth"" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say ""these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future."" however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So ""the long run"" point is vague and meritless.

Investing has certainly changed from 100 years ago when Intelligent Investor was written, though obviously many of the principals still apply, how do you adapt?",1630771685
12,investing,Question about technical markets infrastructure,"Hi, I'm quite new to trading in general and I'm still learning a lot of stuff as I go on. I had a more technical question, which I'm not completely sure this is the right place to ask, but I figured it's an interesting topic and it's still related to investments and trading, so it may be useful for other people as well.

This being said, my question is about the general market infrastructure, i.e. how do markets work not at an economical level, but on a technical level? Years ago, trading was done using literal pen and paper, nowadays everything is computerized and what I'm really interested in is how the whole system and infrastructure works.

For example, when I buy 1 stock of AAPL using my broker website, what is really going on underneath?  The system is matching my order against a sell order of 1 AAPL stock and making the exchange, right? But what happens if more people do the same thing at the same time? Is there a queue of orders? So is it possible that my order won't be executed if there are no sell orders because they were all already executed against an equal number of buy orders?

So, I hope you got the point of my question, as a TLDR I just want to learn a bit more about how modern online market infrastructures are designed, and would really appreciate if somebody has some resources that explain this topic more in detail. Thanks!",1630762253
14,investing,Watch out for Variable annuities,"The worst financial decision I ever made was getting 200k worth of variable annuities with Met Life

As Anthony Robbins says in his book Money master the game, variable annuities are invariably bad.

I held on to my annuities for 13 years so that they would get back to their ore subprime mortgage crash values.  I should have bailed out and cut my losses.  Met Life and the salesman stole 13 years of the future value of my money.

Variable annuities are extremely complex products where you pay through the nose in layered fees.  Snd when you analyze the numbers, it’s a raw deal",1630755225
29,investing,"When will the economy return to ""normal""?"," Everywhere I go I see price increases, places state their disributor increased the prices. For example, theres a special toothpaste I use from my local dentist, it used to cost $12, now its $20. The prices of used cars have skyrocketed. The local motorcycle dealers cannot get any stock and I am unable to buy a bike, as everything is sold immedaitley. All used veichles are selling for ridiclous prices. Everything seems disrupted. There are wanted signs everywhere for labor.  


When do you suspect production of goods and services return to normal to meet demand? Do you expect a change in QE or increase in interest rates? Do you suspect the production side of the economy to rebound and meet demand (and when?) to cease the current price gouging and increased costs of goods, or do you suspect this to be the new normal?",1630739669
31,investing,What are the best means of accessing leverage in tax advantaged accounts?,"These accounts vary in restrictions depending on jurisdiction, but essentially the main commonalities are limited ability to position short (long puts only), and no direct access to margin. 

Off the top of my head :

1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)

Downsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry

2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)

downsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio

3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) 

downsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales

4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account 

downsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts

Are there any other methods i'm missing?  Thoughts on what the best way is? I feel like it's likely deep ITM options. Eg - SPY 150C for Dec 2023 costs ~$30k rn, gives you a notional position of 45k for a leverage ratio of 1.5x.",1630738064

63,investing,Casino Stocks Are Sizzling After Fierce Covid Downturn," 

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

## Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

## Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

## Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

67,investing,A Canadian trust is Likely Accelerating the World's Uranium Shortage.,"There's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

For some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  

Coincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   

I think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  

I think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  

TLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.

75,investing,Investors Are Ignoring the Tax Elephant in the Room,"Barrons

President Biden’s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it’s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats’ slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.

Don’t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year’s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.

For instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald’s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino’s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).

86,investing,What is the threat of cryptocurrency industry on the financial industry?,"Currently, the cryptocurrency market cap is at 2.292 Trillion USD.   
[source](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

Other people are getting into the game, creating coins and institutions are operating exchanges, where they trade and where people can ""stake."" (where they lend their coins out - to be used in other trades) and earn interest. **Everything is unregulated.**

90% of the trade volume is done through derivatives and options with crypto as the underlying asset.  
These has lead to a lot of price manipulation.

On these exchanges, they use stable coins to make purchases where the price is supposedly pegged 1 USD per stable coin. One in particular, tether, is the most popular stable coin, operating out of the Cayman islands. - completely deregulated. There has been scandal after scandal surrounding this stable coin as it is known they are not pegged 1 USD per stable coin however most of the trade volume is done using tether token. **Tether has a 66.5billion USD market cap and like 14 employees on linkedin... they are responsible for the majority of trading volume in the cryptocurrency space.**  
This one stable coin, there are others with the same issue.

So, FED has got wind of this industry and they are worried about the effect of stable coins on the entire financial industry. Essentially, they have evidence that the stable coins might collapse and trigger runs (massive sell offs or people trying to withdraw their money when the exchanges don't have enough money to pay them out). The industry is now operating on debt (through loans (staking) and exchanges taking major commercial loans to operate) and they have derivatives with multipliers. And it is all unregulated. 

So when the FED tapers and we see a 10% - 20% correction later in the fall. People are saying that will trigger a massive sell off in the entire financial industry. AND because there is an excessive amount of short positions in the financial industry (they're not talking about crypto industry).  Some are saying that it will trigger a bigger correction that 20%. 

Also the federal reserve has introduced crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill designed to tax crypto industry more vehemently. Saying that people (stakers, exchangers and miners) will simply not have the information needed to comply. 

That legislation will be signed hopefully end of September or October 1stish. Crypto enthusiasts claim it will forced many exchange to have to de list and re list. Crypto enthusiasts also say the way the law is written is too vague and so many in the industry will not have the ability to

So my questions are:  


1) How will tapering effect the crypto industry AND how will that affect the non crypto financial industry?

2) How will the financial industry react to the signing of the infrastructure bill?

2) To minimize adverse effects of tapering should tapering be announced before or after the bill is signed?",1630691795

95,investing,Any real believers in Michael Burry’s predictions on index funds?,"I have been looking into it recently and I think he has a point. Index funds are extremely overvalued because they are too popular. People do not know what actual companies they own shares in, they just expect a crazy 7/8% return in a year. People will realize this, and eventually pull their money out, which could cause a chain reaction of stock prices dropping to the point where the whole economy could collapse. And if people do not realize, they still are subject to very unfortunate consequences if the stock market crashes from other bubbles like the tech bubble. With more people investing now than ever before, a crash could be 10x more brutal with nearly 50% of americans invested (20/30% of that being directly in index funds).

I also think the worst outcome we could see is the collapse of smaller businesses, since an index fund crash/pullout would hurt small businesses that receive a large part of their funding and have most company stock included in index funds. An index fund collapse could put a lot of small businesses out, but big business will survive and get even bigger. From a market analysis point that would say to invest in big business once it crashes, but from a morality stance some of these companies are already way too big (Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc).

59,investing,Union Bank hate thread and question,"Where do I begin.

After 15 years of banking, 10 of which with a very successful business account earning a few million a year, I was sent a letter stating my account would be closed in 30 days.  

No explanation.

No details

Just a phone number......to an answering machine....that says nobody answers this line and to leave a message.

My branch seemed puzzled.  They called their superiors.  Everyone gave me the same number.  After 4 calls left, someone finally calls me back.  They say they don't have any additional information for me other than a standard ""you no longer fit into our risk assesment tolerance"".  

To add insult to injury, after I happily migrate my accounts to another institution, and add a business account for my new business, they then send the same letter, with the same number, stating my credit card is also going to be closed and I will need to continue to make payments.  They close the account, and my credit immediately goes down 25 points.

Mind you, I have not started laundering money, have not changed my spending habits, maintained a healthy balance, and am not late on any credit card payments....including through the pandemic.  

So beyond the horrific treatment and simply unprofessional disaster that is this banking institution, do I have any legal recourse here?   I realize it might be a bit hollow, but if I am being honest.....I'm willing to dedicate some time and resources to this just to sound the alarm on this behavior and not let them ""get away with it"".

Sadly, it seems I'm a little late to the party because every company I've seen is ridiculously overvalued imo. I'm not usually a stickler for high valuations, but these guys are on another level. 

ZS has a P/S of 61.66, DDOG has 54.21 P/S, NET has a whopping P/S of 72, and CRWD has a whopping 53 P/S and 15 PEG.

The only one I can see that seems relatively okay is PANW with a forward P/E of 63, a P/S of 10, and a PEG of 2.32. not amazing, but I can see how it could outperform.

I know these numbers don't mean everything, and there are other reasons why I believe they are overvalued, but I have never researched an industry that consistently had this high of valuations compared to sales. Yes, some of these guys are growing 100% YoY consistently, but that'll still take years for them to grow into their valuations, assuming their prices stay stagnant until then.

Is this just a symptom of the industry right now, or are there some genuinely good buys in Cybersecurity or data protection that have ground-level valuations?

81,investing,Anybody hedging heavily against a downtown?,"Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. 

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

If you think this is possible, or heck even if you don’t, humor me and let me know how you’d invest. I’ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can’t print its way out of the PE bubble it’s created.

82,investing,"Why is ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investing seen as ""WOKE"" investing and a scam?","ESG Investing is a relatively new (compared to most other types) of investing strategy.  


Companies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.** 

The high ESG is essentially a scoring that communicates a company's ability to be more sustainable, environmentally friendly and operate in a more work place friendly culture and so these companies tended to weather economic storms (so to speak) better than their counterparts. Again, over the long term.  


ESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level.    
Therefore, these companies high in ESG Scores have statistically proven to outperform competitors in the long term. Therefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital.   


So we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.  


So why do so many consider ESG ""a scam"" or ""woke"" investing? Is it because it introduces a class system in the public equity space that they consider themselves to be lesser in?",1630607653

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",1630603091

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

11,investing,Heavily indebted Chinese developer Evergrande warns of default risk,"[**Read the full article here**](https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6)  


&gt;Evergrande has warned it risks defaulting on its debt if it fails to raise cash, as China’s most heavily indebted property developer battles to stave off an unfolding liquidity crisis.  The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.    
&gt;  
&gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks.... 

I'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.

With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **this is NOT likely to default** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. 

With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this.",1630590878

If an investor with shares have a stop-loss order at 95$ and another one has it at 90$, which one would be executed earlier?

Imvestor 1 because he has 'waited longer' for a buy order or investor 2 because he has perfectly matched the price set by the buyer?

Chargepoint reported a second-quarter loss of $84.9 million, or 29 cents a share, after reporting a loss of $35.3 million a year ago. Sales increased to $56.1 million from $35 million a year prior, with more than $40 million credited to its networked charging systems.

Analysts on average expected a loss of 13 cents a share on sales of $49.1 million, according to FactSet. After closing with a 0.4% gain at $21.23, shares jumped to more than $23.50 in the extended session following Wednesday’s report.

With the sales beat, executives increased their annual guidance to sales of $225 million to $235 million, after previously stating a target of $195 million to $205 million. For the third quarter, the forecast calls for revenue of $60 million to $65 million.

20,investing,The biggest catalyst in recent history is showing results for the uranium sector,"Since I started posting on uranium last year, a lot has happened in the sector and we have seen equities increase multiples across the board. There have been plenty of catalysts that have spurred on this move, including reactor life extensions, COVID mine disruptions, new reactor buildouts, capital flows, shut down of supply and several more. A new catalyst has entered this market in recent weeks however and has had an immediate positive effect on the sector. This catalyst was Sprott taking over uranium participation corporation and converting it into the Sprott uranium trust. After everything was said and done, they implemented their USD $300 million ATM and went to work putting in a front curve bid for physical uranium (an oversimplification to be fair, but I want to keep this post short and to the point as to not stray too far off of the main point).

And putting in a bid they did, surprising perhaps even the most bullish expectations, as they went on to add approximately 2,7 million pounds of uranium in just 2 weeks and they are showing no signs of stopping at this point. To give you all some context, that 2,7 million pounds is roughly equivalent to the annual fuel needs of 6 standard 1GW reactors. There was already a firm supply/demand gap in place that formed that basis for this uranium bull thesis and Sprott will widen this gap even further in the months ahead. This will likely accelerate if they can acquire a NYSE listing in Q1 or Q2 of next year, opening the door to additional capital that wants to participate in this bull market via a liquid and well managed vehicle, causing the purchasing of additional pounds in the process.

This trust is an absolute game changer for the sector, as it provides the market with something it has not really seen in this magnitude before, with a consistent bidder in the uranium spot market that can really ramp up the price of physical uranium. Equities will follow this rise and there is no saying what this trust could achieve for the sector once it gets fully up and going. There is also still plenty of time for it to achieve that ramp up, as the price of uranium still needs to rise by roughly another 80% at least to incentivize enough new production for some form of breakeven across the market. However, that break even appears to not be enough to fix the current and upcoming supply/demand gap and an overshoot in price is looking more likely by the day given prevailing circumstances.

There are a lot of moving parts to this vehicle and I have been working hard to put the puzzle together and this post is merely a short summarized version of that work, but I can firmly say that this is the catalyst that has the potential to supercharge what was already a very compelling investment case. I will be watching the developments closely and the coming 2-4 years have never looked as bullish for this sector in my opinion. Should you have any questions regarding this development or uranium in general, please let me know below or via a message and I will be glad to help out. Thank you for reading, please always make sure to do your own due diligence as well and I hope you all have a good and healthy rest of your day.",1630587324

I love love love cybersecurity stocks, think they are in an underdeveloped sector that has plenty of challenges that will be addressed by many of the stocks like CRWD, FTNT, PANW, etc in the future

HOWEVER

I am most concerned out of any sector of stocks in the cybersecurity space when tapering begins or starts to become a real issue (in maybe 4-6 months?). To me, these stocks which are both tech and growth in a space that is still so under defined is going to suffer the most from taper more than tech names that have proven reliable for years and years, and bc the sector has easily done the best out of any ""growth"" stock in the past year or so.

First things first, if we want our money to stretch we have to think outside the box 
 Although I do believe in this company, I would like to help Microvast gain traction in the EV battery industry. In order for me to do that I need to make sure we’re all on the same page. Microvast does make me wet, but not wet enough. You know what would make me wet enough ? If we could dispose of the people spreading false information/ their worthless opinions. It is affecting the community as a whole and it’s rusting our tracks. 
THE INTRODUCTORY SOLUTION  
First we need to somehow contact Jimmy Neutron, I’ve been studying his work for years and he is extremely knowledgeable. Some of his in inventions include ‘but are not limited to’ 
Gravitrax SK30,
Burp powered jet pack ,
Spoofinator 3000,
ION Ray,
And my personal favorite, Laser Sword

SOLUTION
Long story short, contact Mr.Neutron about the mass manufacturing of thicker electrodes (that preform well) with aqueous processing. As this will ultimately lower battery cost. A lower cost of battery’s will help enable widespread adoption of our company, which will lead to higher earnings, which will then lead to our stock increasing in value, which will lead to more money in our pockets.

The section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.

Financial Outlook:

Okta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.",1630527595

Updated coverage: Did 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify

Will the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?

Good day everyone,

We are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)

After closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.

Remember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.

The hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.

Hop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.

The fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.

The hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.

original report below

TL,DR - 22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops

Massive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.

Good day everyone,

Coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)

On August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.

When I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.

I often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.

When we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.

In a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”

95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.

XXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.

XXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.

**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.

**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).

The XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.

Stay tuned for more of our coverage on 22nd Century Group coming very soon.

**Much more DD coming including FDA and mandated lower nicotine by the Biden administration**

About 22nd Century Group, Inc.22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA’s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking. **The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**

90,investing,Keep Rental Property or Invest in stocks??,"What’s up everybody, looking for some advice and feedback on my situation. I’m 34, have 3 kids, wife doesn’t work, and I am fortunate enough to own a rental property with no mortgage.  I net about $1250/month after HOA, taxes, insurance etc. that doesn’t include unexpected expenses like fixing the AC or dishwasher etc. 

Currently, I really like the cash flow from the rental because it helps cover our own expenses like day care and mortgage on our house. 

But I’m wondering if it might be smarter to just sell the rental and put everything into SPY or something and hope to see it grow. 

If I were to sell the rental today I could probably get about $275k, and then subtract 6% realtor fees and also 20% of 50k in capital gains (bought for 225k about 4 years ago). So lets say I come out of it with 250k (if I did the math right). Would I be better off taking the 250k and putting into the market to let it cook for 20 years, occasionally pulling from it when I need it or is it better to keep the rental, invest some the income and then watch the equity on the house grow over time?

I would love to hear if anyone has similar experiences or is good at running a comparison model.

I think the end game is I would be most inclined to do whatever provides the most long term growth versus short term advantages.

**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**

Payment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.

Might you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.

Think about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions? I think so.

Even if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).

It used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:

&gt;...  
we literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  
...  
in aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  
...  
If I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  
...  
So anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these ""indicators"" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  
...  
So if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  
...  
The remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.

This makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.

If I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.

Now let's look at front running.

Here's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):

&gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.

English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):

&gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.

If I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.

It seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.

Obviously the GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:

&gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.

I will leave you with a link to [an interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb1dx3/brokerages_list_by_payment_for_order_flow/) that outlines what brokers charge for PFOF.",1630412062
82,investing,Anyone excited for Paytm IPO? (i.e. largest payment processor in India aka India's paypal),"India is probably a country that is under-invested in, and probably for good reason, but Paytm, which Berkshire Hathaway, Softbank, and Alibaba have large stakes in, is the most promising IPO I have seen. 

It competes with many companies but has large, 65%-70%, marketshare. The company is doing I believe $500 million in revenue this year and hoping to double that by 2023. It's in a region that has staggering payments growth; huge, not comprobable to the US right now, and I'm thinking where china was a few years ago.

I'm hoping the IPO doesn't get too big; and it may not since IPO market has been that crazy last few months compared to other times. The company projects $25-$30 billion ipo. That's an okay deal; not great but not terrible. If it's $50 billion+ then it may go the way of Facebook or flat-line for a few years.  it's anything like Paypal, or Square however, and all signs point to it being something similar yes, then an invstor can reap huge returns over 10-15 years if shares can be picked up in the $20 billion range.",1630394358
89,investing,How to long-term invest in a weakly inefficient market with no sign of random walk?,"From many beginners books recommended on this site (Bogleheads, Random walk down Wall Street, The Four Pillars of Investing), the argument for long-term index investing lies on the assumption that the market is efficient and the stock price characteristic is that of a random walk. What would happen then, if that wasn't the case anymore, as in many frontier markets? Does long-term investment in stock still makes sense? Is index ETF still a good choice when the extra TER in active funds eats up the larger return? Or it's better to find less volatile forms of investment? How can it be that the large cap index is weakly efficient and shows signs of random walk, while the rest of the market isn't?

For context, in Vietnam - a frontier market, saving interest has for the first time dip below the average index return of the last decade and current corporate bond rate. The stock market trading volume has doubled in less than 2 years, with a huge influx of new, inexperienced investors and is on the second largest rally in the mere 20 years of its existence.",1630385740

By creating and then selling a token that represents this copyrightable asset, investors can participate in the benefits. The investors can also gain from price appreciation should the asset become more valuable or sell it for a profit.

In the case of crypto-collectibles, the crypto-collectible asset represents the asset that is owned by the company. This is a new type of asset that has not been seen before. In this case, the investor is buying ownership in the company and the asset represents a portion of that ownership.

Note- The results do not indicate if the companies drug was approved or denied. Only the move after the date.

TLDR:

The average 24hr change in a stock price after the announcement was: -2.8%

The average 1 week change in a stock price after the announcement was: -6.7%

For those that are not familiar with what a PDUFA date is (from Google):

The PDUFA date refers to **the date the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are expected to deliver their decision whether or not a approve a companies New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA)**

Methodology: The PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date was found then the stock price was pulled using GOOGLEFINANCE in sheets. From there a % change calculation was made on the 24hr price change and 1 week change. All biotech stocks that had a PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date from 1/1/21 - 8/23/21 were analyzed and an average was taken. Any outliers are highlighted in either green or red.

22,investing,Advice for evaluating a company,"I’ve been investing for about 9 months now. Over the past few months I’ve been trying to learn how to make evaluations on my own to find companies I believe to be undervalued. My process has been to look at a company’s market cap. And to compare it to its annual revenue and growth. I also add the total assets of the company and compare that figure to market cap. To see if I believe the current share price is attractive. If the company’s market cap is close to the annual revenue + assets and the growth looks like it could push the company beyond its current market cap, I invest.

These are pretty easy stats to pull up and understand so I’m asking for advice from more seasoned investors on how I should evaluate a company and if my evaluation method even makes sense as I could be totally missing something as a few months ago I didn’t even know what market cap meant.

35,investing,Ideas To Calculate Valuation for Crypto?,"I saw an article on Yahoo Finance the other day about an analyst's call for Ethereum to hit $10,000 by the end of 2021, link below, and it reminded me a question I've had for a long time: how are price targets calculated for crypto currencies? As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above. Is there anything like that for crypto? And if so, what?

*Fulgent has a growing* [*genetic testing business*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/genetic-testing-stocks/)  *for pediatric diseases, which management expects to generate revenue of  $110 million in 2021, representing a 201% year-over-year increase.  That’s a growth story investors should be following.*

*The  potential for multi-cancer screening is mind boggling — in both  financial and human terms.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in colored boxes  above. For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.

56,investing,How Are Price Targets Calculated for Crypto?,"I saw an article on Yahoo Finance the other day about an analyst's call for Ethereum to hit $10,000 by the end of 2021, link below, and it reminded me a question I've had for a long time: how are price targets calculated for crypto currencies? As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above. Is there anything like that for crypto?

72,investing,Somewhat crash-resilient asset classes,"I'm looking for diversification of my portfolio to be somewhat resilient w.r.t. crashes. As usual, I'm writing a bit of a preface before coming to the point.

As probably most investors are, I'm currently mainly invested in stocks, mostly several ETFs. I'm planning to rebalance soon, so I'm re-thinking how exactly. I'm -- compared to most recommendations -- currently a bit heavy on US stocks because it went so well in the last years so the position is larger than it was. I'm a bit heavy on Europe, but that's kind of on principle since I'm located there and like to be a bit Europe-heavy, and I'm certainly too low on rest of the world and Emerging Markets. I have a little bit in Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds, but that's not too much.

Now, everyone will agree at some point there will be a crash. So do I, but as everybody who is honest to themselves I have no idea when. Could be tomorrow, could be some point in the next year, could be in a couple years, could be in 10 years. I simply don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. If I knew when a crash will happen things would be very easy: Sell everything, go short, and buy again after the crash.

But what I do know is that when there is a crash, it's good to have some money to buy. I could set aside some war chest in cash and just wait. But that money will be slowly eaten by inflation and certainly not increase in value.

If I were to invest some of the money in other asset classes other than stocks, ideally some which would not go down the same as stocks in a stock market crash, I could gain some value, and when the crash comes just rebalance the extra cash I have there to stocks after the crash for added benefit.

If you think about it, that's diversification across asset classes. I've read a bit on Google what people recommend there, and here's a breakdown of possibilities, and my opinion on them:

* Government bonds (US and the stable European ones). The good news is they are not so correlated to the stock market. In fact, for the 2007/2008 crash, they've done very well. For the 2020 crash, they fell rapidly as well, although not as much as the stock market. They give some interest, but it's certainly very limited. Seems a bit better than just holding the cash, but not much. Also, if I'm investing in US government bonds (which pay better interest than e.g. German bonds) I have the currency risk. I could hedge that, but that would cost a bit of the meagre profit...
* Commodities/precious metals. I don't get that one. I understand that some of them might go up in a crash. But they don't generate any interest by themselves, it's pure speculation. An ounce of gold is just the same ounce of gold in 10 years. Under a lot of assumptions I could say that it might be a hedge against inflation and thus better than holding cash. But it's nothing that will provide any returns beyond inflation by just passively investing.
* Real Estate (direct investment). It's a shitload of work, it's very risky since it's hard to diversify unless you have a lot of cash to invest there. I don't want that.
* Real Estate (through REITs or Real Estate stocks/ETFs). Much easier to realize, but questionable how much it helps with diversification. The Real Estate ETFs all went down pretty much the same as the stock market last year, and while not many of them existed, the 2007/2008 crash was caused by real estate, so I don't expect this to have been very resilient (but I'm looking into whether the problem here is that weighting by market-cap might be a bad idea here...). This might be an asset class a bit more robust than the overall market, but I am skeptical. On top of that, I'm shocked about the dividend rates here, I expected a lot of them to be much higher. Adding a bit of that is likely fine.
* Tune weighting of industries/regions based on their performance in the last years. With that, I mean thoughts like: US stock market went extremely well the last years, so if there should be a crash, it has the biggest possibility to fail -&gt; have less US. Consumer Staples and Energy did worse than the market the recent years -&gt; more of those, since they won't fall as much in a crash. Tech stocks went exceptionally well, so they have the most potential to fall -&gt; less of those. This will mitigate the risk (although I'm skeptical on the Energy part), I guess, but also limit growth for the current market situation.
* Cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly high correlation to the stock market if I look at the charts. They crashed last year. Also, they're pretty high right now and their intrinsic value is a bit questionable. I'm not completely against investing a small portion of my portfolio there, but I'm not overly convinced of this. If they had a clear negative correlation, it would show that they are regarded as an alternative when the traditional market fails. But I can't see that being the case right now.
* P2P lending. I'm skeptical. It's completely unregulated, so there's counterparty risk. It's hyped a lot by influencers, which rings alarm bells. And if I look at bondora, which seems to have shifted the focus to their ""Gain&amp;Grow"" product, that gives 6.75% per year, but has a 1% withdrawal fee and a 400 EUR maximum investment per month, this looks fishy. This industry also had trouble last year, with withdrawal restrictions and higher default rates, so its resilience in crashes is also questionable. It's its own asset class, but lack of transparency and regulation make me be very hesitant here.

Chinese regulators on Monday slashed the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend on online games to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and holidays, in response to growing concern over gaming addiction, state media reported.

The rules, published by the National Press and Publication Administration, said users under the age of 18 would be able to play games only from 8pm to 9pm local time on those days, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Online gaming companies would be barred from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside those hours and would need to ensure they had put real name verification systems in place, said the regulator, which oversees the country’s video games market.

Previously, China limited the total length of time minors could access online games to three hours on holiday or 1.5 hours on other days.

The new rules come amid a broad crackdown by Beijing on China’s tech giants, such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, which has unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.

The National Press and Publication Administration also told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems.",1630326694
80,investing,Pay off loan and lose liquidity vs keep trading until the same amount is made?,"Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade:

- $20k
- $10k
- $6k from my girlfriend
- $4k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing. At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished my $10k loan, and I'm constantly re-financing my credit cards with credit card money (so no loss there). My girlfriend doesn't want her money back, so that's good.

My problem is, I'm still $27k in debt with the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even. If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?

81,investing,Mining companies and engaging with communities and environmental advocacies,"A lot of mining sites of a chunk mining companies are located in various parts of the world. Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.

For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the [Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations](https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx), whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”

The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.

Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible. All these globalization and the current climate of economic rationalism is making these people less human and deprived of compassion and sense of responsibility.",1630326196

34,investing,"My experience in creating the worst crypto coin ever - Turning Crypto Investments, to a vision.","Hi Crypto Enthusiasts,

Today I'll be sharing my journey in aiming to create one of the worst tokens (memecoin) ever deployed, from the very start. This could be a beneficial adventure for those seeking to start a new project, or those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, hope you enjoy it!

Just in the end of July, after ""memecoins"" and crypto in general is forming a buzz word for a while especially after some making huge profits, a team was chosen to make something different. As a head start, memecoins are cryptocurrencies that have might not have utilities but grow based on their visions and targets, proven to be massively profitable in vast case studies. Having said that, the team want to address an issue or solve a problem, carrying a mentality that if we want to put any effort in this, it must have a life-changing impact!

So the initial step is to look at how to write the smart contract, which was obvious at that point to be mainly forked and standard by vast of the existing legit memecoin projects. Such projects rely on the what so called ""tokenomics"" to attract investors, which is in essence a percentage payable as tax, which is then redistributed according to how much an investor is holding. For instance, the buyer will buy 100 coins, then get only 90, where the 10 will be redistributed to all the holders, which will be repaid to the buyer in the same manner. So, We noticed that this tokenomics is actually profitable to the devs, the marketing wallet, and the very top holders only. So we decided to make the taxes zero; getting out from the memecoin concept aren't we? - Well, we kept pushing forward.

So it was decided, no fees will result in no redistribution, so what's next? the most important aspect, which is the vision of the whole project. So what issue will we be addressing? How can we make the maximum impact within a market where trust is becoming an issue perhaps threatening its existence?

We had an idea to track vast crypto articles and groups to identify the most repetitive word, guess what was that? yes, Fear - Doubt - Uncertainty aka F. U. D.

So what would we do with this word? we continued to monitor and note the activities of tens of memecoin groups until we noticed that the use of the word is mainly accompanied by a ban. And this was the weirdest point ever. So if an investor is doubting, he/she will be banned. If an investor is crossing the boundaries by asking where is his/her money, they get banned. Weirdest thing we ever saw, and couldn't understand. I mean, isn't an investor the same as a customer contributing to the success of the project? isn't the investor rightful to ask for progress even if it hurts developer/owner/admin feelings?

From there the idea was born; with a bit of research, it was noticed that criticism could mainly be constructive, and by constructive we can link ""care"". In other words, those who care are being silenced and banned which could be negatively impacting crypto adoption.

From this ideology we adopted the concept that says: fudding isn't bad, it is actually good! and this was the starting point, deploying an honorable idea token, with zero tax, we named it the FUDcoin Official. We created the Telegram group, pages, etc. So what is next? the marketing.

How can we market a coin that represent negativity, and make it so easy for everyone to understand what we stand for? and there it was, so obvious, negative marketing. So the marketing strategy being adopted (for the first time ever in Crypto), is that this is the worst project ever (perhaps this could make it the best). And here we go, we have the ethos, the vision, the roadmap, the token, and the strategy, and guess what? it was huge! everyone liked it. Negative marketing is hereby tested for the first time in the same market the rely heavily on positivism.  

Finally, we needed to set a launching date. What would the best possible launching date be to represent fear, negativity, doubt, and uncertainty? We googled the worst day and saw that in every year, if the 13th day of a calendar month hits a Friday, this could be the worst, representing bad luck. Opening our calendar guess what, Aug 13th, a Friday, in few days! Isn't that a sign? We believe it was.

For here folks this is part one of two parts, stay tuned to the post launch story, the results, and the angry marketing girl.

So this is how you make money.  


The game is to make sure you get in and out before too many other people decide to dump it.   


Someone can tweet the price might go up a bit, false news about amazon adopting it (or some other news) gets created to drive the price up, exchanges pay news channels to have bitcoin talking heads on to promote this speculation,  the chinese miners get shut down (and dump) the price tanks, 

Not to mention the ticking time bomb that is the fraudulent stablecoins (operating off the cayman islands) or how 90% of the trades in cryptocurrencies is done by futures/options trading off the sketchy exchanges (manipulating the price) many of which are in the cayman islands.  


Right now, why is bitcoin considered an ""investment"" and not a gamble?",1630200679

So really the split is more like 65% growth and 35% high yield dividends with QYLD.

I know the consensus is to focus on growth until retirement but I want to have the dividends as supplemental income along the way, not just for retirement. I backtested this portfolio and it was able to track back to Jan 2017. The account balance doubled in 4.5yrs and I'm happy with that.

&gt;  
&gt;The e-commerce giant is partnering with [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) for its first-ever installment payments option on the popular e-commerce site.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s buy now, pay later checkout option will be available to certain Amazon customers in the U.S. starting Friday with a broader rollout in the coming months, the companies said in a statement. The partnership will let Amazon customers split purchases of $50 or more into smaller, monthly installments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s stock spiked as much as 48% after-hours Friday on the news, adding more than $8 billion to its market capitalization, later settling up around 33%. Amazon shares were unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Friday’s partnership is the latest sign of the booming lending space as younger consumers move towards these alternative lines of credit. Earlier in August, Square jumped into the space with a $29 billion [deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/square-to-buy-australia-fintech-afterpay-amid-buy-now-pay-later-trend.html) to buy Australian fintech Afterpay.  
&gt;  
&gt;So-called installment loans have been around for decades, and were historically used for big-ticket purchases such as furniture. Online payment players and fintechs have been [competing ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/pay-later-is-booming-with-a-wave-of-companies-launching-installments.html)to launch their own version of “pay later” products for online items in the low hundreds of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm is one of the best known installment payment options. It works with more than 12,000 merchants, including [Peloton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PTON) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT).  
&gt;  
&gt;[PayPal](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PYPL), Klarna, [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA) and Fiserv, [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP), [Citi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C) and [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM) are all offering similar loan products. [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL) is planning to launch installment lending in a partnership with [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS), Bloomberg reported last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm said some of the Amazon customer loans will bear interest, but some will come with 0% APR.  
&gt;  
&gt;“By partnering with Amazon we’re bringing the transparency, predictability and affordability that Affirm provides today to the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com in the U.S.,” Eric Morse, Senior Vice President of Sales at Affirm, said in a statement. “Offering Affirm’s alternative to credit cards also delivers more of the payment choice and flexibility consumers on Amazon want.”

43,investing,Buffett wannabe: Sardar Biglari,"It seems like Biglari is trying a bit too hard to emulate what Buffett did. Looking at his company's fundamentals, there are some very attractive features financially, but the declining businesses owned by Biglari were my first red flag. Biglari started by buying Shake Shack, and now owns five businesses that in my opinion are all not great. He currently owned over 60 percent of Biglari holdings via his own personal shell company, Biglari capital corp, which coincidentally owns 50 million in Berkshire Hathaway. 

He holds annual meetings similar to how Berkshire does, but according to past attendees, the meetings usually involve shareholders berating him for ridiculously high compensation.   Unlike Buffett, Biglari did not start by being an investor, but instead sold a company he owned at the peak of the internet bubble. He also lives lavishly, with a huge house, expensive suits, and a wife who looks like a gold digger of gold diggers. What really made me look at him as a Buffett wannabe was the company website. Take a look at [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) versus [Biglari](http://www.biglariholdings.com/).

Personally, I would not touch this company, I don't think Biglari is acting rationally but rather trying to fill an ideal even if his journey involves making bad decisions.

The Irvine, California-based startup said in a statement Friday that it submitted its S-1 registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. The company would like to do an IPO around the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the filing was confidential. The timing will depend on approval from the SEC.

Should Rivian go public at an $80 billion market capitalization, it would be one of the biggest debuts on that basis this year.

61,investing,Lessons from Peter Thiel on investing,"**#1 Progress and profits come from monopolies, not competition**

Capitalism is about accumulating wealth. But in a world of perfect competition, nobody actually makes any money; all economic profits are competed away. Competition should be avoided wherever possible. Rather it is worthwhile to think about how to run away from the fighting and build a monopoly business instead.

**#2 A company messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed**

It’s pretty much impossible to fix a bad company culture when you already have thousands of employees. Make sure you’re investing in a company that has had the right culture since day one.

**#3 Founders are built different**

Most traits are probably normally distributed. Most people are average. Founders are not. Founders’ traits seem to have an inverse normal distribution to them. Founders are at the extremes on both ends: they are extreme insiders and extreme outsiders, disagreeable and charismatic, infamous and famous.

**#4 Great companies have “secrets”**

Risk aversion and complacency discourage people from thinking about secrets. Existing conventions are much more comfortable. But secret truths can be incredibly valuable. The question of how many secrets exist in our world is roughly equivalent to how many startups people should start. From a business perspective, then, there are many great companies that are waiting to be started.

**#5 The last mover advantage**

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. That can work, but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t matter nearly as much as being the last mover!

**#6 Be a contrarian, but also right**

There is usually little value to be found where there is unanimity. Value tends to be hidden. The key question is: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? The business version of this is: What valuable company is nobody building? A certain degree of contrarianism is embedded in these questions. Wrestling with them can lead to important truths.

62,investing,Salesforce long term growth potential,"Salesforce recently beat earnings expectations and their Slack acquisition plus the Delta varient slowing return to offices means the work from home trend is becoming even more entrenched and common.

All of this makes me believe Salesforce will receive a vastly quicker return on investment on Slack than the market assumes. On top of this, Salesforce is combining their other cloud tools (including Tableau, leading data analytics tool) into Slack.

Salesforce is trading at a lower valuation gap compared to it's competition, despite being better positioned in the wider long-term economy due to Slack.

Salesforce has unrecognized blue-chip potential over the long term, and is building an undervalued economic moat by building a cloud platform on top of Slack to leverage into the ""new normal"" of work-from-home.

70,investing,"Some Thoughts on Fed Policy and ""Policy Mistakes"" As We Start Talking About Tapering","For the people out there who follow the macro environment, there is always a lot of discussion in past market bursts (such as 2008 or 2000) that there are or were fed policy mistakes that either caused or contributed to the meltdown.

This is relevant now because as we come into talks about tapering, there is a lot of chatter about a potential fed policy mistake one way or another. 

But I think this is a poor way to think about these items, and views of mistakes completely ignore the context of the macro environment and ***why*** the fed made the supposed mistakes in the first place. 

**Most Policy Mistakes Are Fed Decisions Where They're Forced To Choose Between Two Bad Choices**

# Fed Policy Quick History: Caught Between Tough Choices

Lets start with a quick history of important fed decisions, many which have been labeled policy errors in the past. 

* **1980-1982 Volcker Rate Shock:** This was the worst recession the USA had since the GFC, and capped off an era where Inflation was the boogeyman and there were multiple bad recessions and employment shocks. At this time, inflation was running extremely hot (over 10%), and it was starting to get out of control. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Raising interest rates would kill the economy, which was already having a tough time dealing with the inflation of the time. Rates would have to rise to 18%, which would seriously cut off lending growth. But it would effectively stem the tide of inflation. Volcker chose the very tough decision to raise rates to 18%, which effectively cut inflation down significantly.   
Another point worth making is that the introduction of Reagonomics was a key factor in reversing the age of inflation of the 1970's, where there was a significant lack of investment in new productive capacity.  At the time, this was extremely beneficial. OF course, we're more or less at the opposite end of that spectrum right now where we have a glut of overinvestment and have possibly taken the 80's policies too far (obviously subject to political debate and views).  
* **1998 LTCM Bailout:** This was a historic bailout that occurred during a time of a lot of international market turmoil (Asian financial crisis + Russian default) and a burgeoning US equity bubble (dotcom bubble was starting to really pick up steam here).  The sudden failure of LTCM however threatened systemic issues in the financial system, and thus became the first bailout of a private hedge fund by the FED. This was a new precedent, and many believe it kickstarted the parabolic phase of the dotcom bubble. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Do you allow the LTCM meltdown to spill into the rest of the US banking system and economy, or do you bail out LTCM and support the economy + job growth? The fed chose the latter, which at the time supported their mandate of stable prices and full employment. They did not have a crystal ball suggesting an even greater equity bubble would form from this. 
* **2000-2003 Dotcom Bubble Burst:** After likely contributing to the dotcom bubble with the LTCM bailout and interest rate decrease, inflation started to rise a bit in late 1999, and credit growth and equity mania forced the Fed's hand to cap the bubble before it became even more difficult to control. The fed did a few emergency rate hikes, and the credit cycle quickly turned down, which had been feeding the dotcom mania. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Critics of the fed would have said that the emergency rate hike burst the bubble. Critics of the fed also said that they let the bubble get out of hand. Literally, there was no good choice here except to bite the bullet and hope the landing wasn't too hard. In reality, the *real* economy did have a soft landing in the dotcom bubble, partially thanks to the fed's interest rate decrease after the bubble really started to get going. 
* **2007-2008 GFC:** After dropping interest rates to keep the economy afloat during the GFC, very few people wanted anything to do with equities, especially tech stocks. This caused a shift in behavior towards real estate, which was already quite strong and resilient even during the dotcom crash. At the same time, the global economy was recovering from the crises of the late 90's and dotcom era, the euro was being adopted as a currency, and China was rising as a member of the world trade organization. All of the above created a perfect storm for US real estate getting piled into via carry trades, while the US Dollar was getting depreciated by all the above factors. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** The fed clearly started to see the monster that was being created in 2005. Not only was credit growth going parabolic + real estate lending going off the charts, but inflation was also surging in the USA due to all the aforementioned factors. Gas prices surged to over 4$ per gallon (at a time when many drove ""clunkers""), Copper surged to very high prices, and real estate / rent was also going parabolic. Greenspan was looking into a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen since the 70's, and was forced to decide between allowing real estate and inflation to go completely unchecked, or to raise rates very quickly to stem the flows from getting more and more out of hand.   
He chose the latter of raising rates, which then led to the chain reaction causing the GFC. Thing is, we don't know how much worse things may have gotten if Greenspan chose to ***not*** raise rates. Think of how much larger the US real estate bubble would have become if it wasn't cut off at the source. As bad as things got in 2008, they could have been worse if they allowed things to continue. 
* **Post GFC Environment:** After the GFC, the Fed shifted stance and most central banks became far more accomodative. The reaction of policymakers to any asset drawdowns has become far quicker and far larger. With that said, there have been some scares where the fed was tightening a little bit, which threatened to choke off the economy. The most noteworthy one was in late 2018, where the rate hikes and QE Rollback caused a 20% drop in markets before the fed reversed policy to engineer the 2019 rebound. This was likely a close call in some regards.   


# Lessons and Takeaways

From all the above, there are a few important lessons for investors when it comes to understanding equity and credit cycles + risk in the macro economy.   


1. **The party likely will or can continue so long as the central bank / government are accomodative:** You'll notice that all of the above recessions occurred during a time when the central banks were ***forced*** to tighten financial conditions.   

2. **Inflation (asset inflation or economic inflation) is always what takes the punch bowl away:** So what causes the fed or government to reverse accommodative policy? Almost always inflation. With a mandate to maintain stable prices and employment, inflation in the real economy tends to damage consumer's wallet and destabilizes prices. Inflation in assets typically comes with credit expansion, and threatens to destabilize employment and prices as it becomes larger and increasingly more fragile. These items generally tie the central banks' hands and force them into tough decisions. The ***levels*** at which the fed is forced to take away the punch bowl however is a lot more subject to opinion, and definitely not precise however.   

3. **Raising rates or tightening policy into an overleveraged environment creates systemic risk:** If you note the difference between the 1980's rate increase from Volcker, and the interest rate increases from the GFC or even in 2018, you'll notice how much more sensitive the economy is to rising rates. And furthermore, you'll likely realize how much more convex the downside gets with the more debt that exists in a system.   

4. **Debt in a system puts a soft cap on long term inflation rates:** Because central banks tend to get forced into action when inflation rears its head, and because the central bank behavior causes debt defaults and credit issues to arise, this forms something of a natural soft ceiling on how high both inflation as well as interest rates will go before triggering a deflationary shock. Once again, this isn't any set level, but you get a good broad view of this by looking at long term interest rates since the 80's, and then looking at aggregate leverage / credit.   

5. **The fed shifting to less accomodative stances isn't consistent with timing of market selloffs or recessions:** If you're trying to time the market based off this alone, you may get it right some times, but other times you would be far off. This timed the top of the dotcom bubble, but also missed out on the top of the GFC by over two years and quite a few rate hikes. It also missed out on most of the gains in 2017 and 2018 despite rising rates.   

6. **The fed doesn't make ""mistakes"", they make choices to deal with the problem at hand over the problems that may occur in the future:** In nearly every situation, the fed's dilemma caused them to choose between dealing with the problem that is currently occurring in the market with the risk that their solution could cause a problem somewhere else down the road. In every instance, the fed chooses to deal with the ***current*** problem over the problem that may be. And most people would not do anything different, because we don't have crystal balls and can't predict the future. I do think the fed has made bad choices, but most of the choices actually fit their **mandate**. In other words, don't hate the player, hate the game.",1629996638

So far, my understanding is:

1. There is no legal precedent to disallow non-residents from opening an account in Canada
2. Any brokerage doing so would need to be licensed in the US (and likely, my state) as well as Canada
3. The paperwork involved in the licensing and reporting mean most brokerages just don't support it

36,investing,Canfor versus West Fraser Timber,"West Fraser timber is a Canadian lumber company that produces and processes wood products. They are traded on the TSX and the NYSE, and they are based in central British Columbia. They are the largest logging company in the world by market cap (11.71B) and by production capacity (6735 MMfbm). Canfor is a very close competitor with a capacity of 6700 MMfbm. 
Canfor has a very similar story. They are based in Vancouver, and despite their high production and production capacity, they are valued at more than ⅓ of WFG.
	The industry is closely tied to economic conditions, and lumber has recently been at record prices. Since then, lumber prices have come down to close to the decade average. The economic concerns here are not very important, but it will be important to consider that the high lumber prices may have artificially boosted operating results. 

A comparison of the two lumber companies (Dollar figures are all in CAD):

|Metric|WFG|Canfor|
:--|:--|:--|
|Market Cap|11.71B|3.34B|
|Revenue|5.850B|5.454B|
|Net Income|776M|559M|
|Lumber production (MMfbm)|5958|5204|
|Debt/Equity|0.2|0.25|
|ROE|24.6%|21%|
|Current Ratio|2.5|2.1|
|Total assets|5.32B|5.108B|
|Total Equity|3.155B|2.664B|



Comparatively, it is quite confusing why Canfor is worth so little. WFG has slightly more sales, net income, production, and balance sheet size. But does an eight percent difference in figures really warrant WFG to be worth almost four times as much as Canfor? They have slightly more efficient operations, and their balance sheet is slightly healthier, but when looking at some of the price ratios such as P/E and P/B, Canfor suddenly becomes more favorable. 
	Canfors’ balance sheet has grown significantly since 2014 from 2.48B to 5.1B, giving us a CAGR of 11%, which is partially attributable to an excessively favorable economic environment. WFGs balance sheet CAGR over the same period is 8%. Sales follow a similar trend. It is more clear now that the lesser's financial position is at the expense of greater growth. 	Constructing a conservative DCF may also provide some more insight. Here are the results I got from my calculations:
	
|Company|Price Range, 10Y DCF|Margin of safety|
:--|:--|:--|
|Canfor @21|$100-$120|79-82%|
|WFG @76|$200-$250|62-69%|



As you can see, the valuations are pretty crazy. I have not seen businesses that can generate cash like this in a long time. Both of them look incredibly attractive on this metric.
	
As an investment thesis, I would have to choose Canfor. They are so similar operationally and in numbers, yet their price is ridiculously low even for a conservative valuation.",1629947560

&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

9,investing,What is your opinion on Barry C Knapp's saying there will be a 10-12% correction if there is tapering announce for Oct. 1st?,"S&amp;P 500 rises to another record on Wednesday, Dow jumps 120 points. 

Powell is expected to make press on economic policy this Friday 08/27/21 
The much anticipated Jackson Hole symposium kicks off on Thursday, where central bankers will potentially provide updates on their plan around tapering monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

I've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. 
This is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. 

Taper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “It’s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn’t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.”

Bell added that the deciding factor could be August’s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.

Several tech companies will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes, including Dow component Salesforce. Box and Snowflake are also on deck.

35,investing,Ratio Review: Price to Sales Ratio,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

Every method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. 

So, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.

#**What is P/S?**
The price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. 

What is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. 

Knowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.

#**Real application**
Most fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.

So now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.

#**The good and the bad of using sales**
Let’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. 

I had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. 

The next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. 

#**Conclusion**
Price to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. 
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.
If you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. 

#**TLDR**
Price to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.

Then when should i take on more riskier portfolios and investment opportunities?*   


*Recently got into crypto and well boy let me tell you, Fundamental Analysis quickly goes out of the window here. It's unregulated, unenforceable, and most countries have no feasible legislation as to its implementation most especially with block chains and smart contracts ( it's basically the new technology which incorporated bitcoin's tech into having utility and purpose ). This is what sold me on crypto currency sometime last year actually when I saw first hand how a block chain network could actually provide utility now. As a fundamental investor on crypto I was sold. Now a decent chunk of my portfolio is in stocks and i'm looking to move it into crypto soon.*

  
To all fundamental analyst of securities and stocks in particular, I've personally been bothered by this for a long time. Why on good earth would a stock sell below its book value ? I mean I just don't get it. It should be no brainer that people should be buying out that stock because if that company closed down tomorrow you'd be getting your money's worth   


If a stock has a book value of let's say 10 usd per share and it's being traded on an exchange for 2 usd per share. Isn't this free 8 usd per share you're taking home ?

1.) delayed purchases ( people won't buy things knowing that their money would deflate in value so they can purchase that new house or new car for fewer monies the next year )   


2.) Deflation causes disruption in loans, bonds, treasury bills and etc. If the Goverment borrows money say 1,000,000 USD to obviously pay its creditors at a higher rate let's sa 2% so 1,020,000 USD because of deflation the purchasing power of 1,020,000 would now be higher than what was originally intended

OPEN recently reported a great Q2, beating estimates with revenue of $1.2B and a net loss of $143M. Q3 projected revenue from the company is $1.8-1.9B and unless I’m not understanding something correctly, I think they are about to post a $3B+ quarter in Q3.

Background: I used to spend 20-30 minutes a day looking through OPEN’s website and calculating the number of homes listed/sold. Was lucky to stumble upon ibuyerstats.com and I’ve found it to be fully reliable, saving me lots of time and it has some helpful analysis. 

Calculation: according to ibuyerstats.com, OPEN has listed 4,989 homes since July 1st. The total number of homes listed on OPEN (only homes that are OPEN owned, not just homes people list themselves) has increased by 503 since July 1st. So a simple calculation tells you that OPEN has sold ~ 4,500 homes so far this quarter. At an average selling price of $400k, OPEN has pulled in revenues of $1.8B in just 53 days (already what they were projecting for the whole quarter).

53 days is 58% of the days in a quarter, and when you add in the other 42% you get revenues of $3.1B, however this doesn’t include revenues from homes listed earlier than the start of Q3, their listing platform, and a general increase in sales that is likely to continue through the remainder of Q3. 

I’m completely open to any criticism as I’m genuinely curious if any of you think this simple calculation is a fair representation of the quarter OPEN is about to deliver.

20,investing,Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.,"Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.

This comes after the [industry’s top gold producers](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/) – Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold, Polyus, Kinross, Gold Fields, Newcrest and Agnico-Eagle – felt the effects of a 6.5% reduction in output to 24.98 million ounces in 2020, following lower ore grades, sale of assets, lower mill throughput and lower recoveries.

But data and analytics firm GlobalData [projects](https://www.globaldata.com/gold-production-top-eight-companies-expected-increase-3-1-2021-says-globaldata/) production from those companies to recover and reach somewhere between 25-25.75 million ounces in 2021.

The most significant falls in production last year were observed amongst the top three companies – Newmont (6.1%), Barrick (12.9%) and AngloGold (7.1%). The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.

Vinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”

Lockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year

For Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.

Meanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.

59,investing,Thoughts on CND.U / Circle?,"Anyone else in CND.U? Curious if anyone has interesting / well developed takes on Circle. Tether is likely a huge scam — whether that’ll blow them up or not is another story. A fun / convincing video on this [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg) by Coffeezilla on YouTube. Circle is the company that runs the second largest stablecoin, USDC, whose market cap is approaching half of tether’s and growing at a quicker rate. They do this with the help of Coinbase. In addition, they are significantly more transparent with their holdings, and they have plans to become a full reserve national digital currency bank. They also make money through their API, allowing companies to use USDC to seamlessly move capital internationally. 

To me, this sounds like a huge opportunity. Absolutely massive if the crypto space continues to grow remotely as quick as it has. My main concerns are around valuation — this is a company unlike literally any public company out there, and is therefore tricky to value. Anyway, I’d like to hear other thoughts &amp; any challenges to my thoughts. Thanks.",1629791381
61,investing,"Long Term SPY Leaps Investment Strategy, What's Your Thoughts?","Hey guys, so I'm pretty new to options (\~1year), and I started out mostly doing short term bets, but recently I've been thinking about using Leaps in my long term investment portfolio.

The idea is simple, but first of all this is my thesis of the strategy:

* The market always go up in long term because of technology advancement, and economic activities.
* Bear market can happen, but usually last at most 5 years. (Probably the riskiest assumption in the entire strategy.)
* Consistent yearly investment into Leaps, for example buy $100k worth of Leaps every year for decades, or gradually increase the yearly investing amount with 5%\~10%.
* Buy OTM+10% SPY Leaps with 3 years expiry, then sell them after 2 years with 1 years left to expiry. (Obviously this part will need more thinking, but the idea is to have a consistent strategy, it can be buying ITM/ATM/OTM, or buying 0.5Delta, or sell every 1 year instead of 2, which I will need to run some back test to find out the best possible option.)

What I think this strategy is that it could outperform the market performance by the leveraging the market performance it self, and maintain a long term consistent (or gradually growing) exposure of SPY.

Obviously another criteria here is not to lose money or turn out wasting time because of the theta decay, that is why I would also sell the call options with \~1year before expiry.

To verify the strategy, I purchased SPX historical data from [historicaloptiondata.com](https://historicaloptiondata.com) and [cboe.com](https://cboe.com), to ""backtest"" the idea of this, because lack of skills in writing custom back test strategy, I only able to backtest manually with one variable at a time.

Because of the hassle of backtesting the strategy, I can only do simple backtest such as buying 1 option per year etc, but what surprise me is the average return of this said strategy are able to outperform dollar cost averaging SPY in the period of 2005-2021 for at least twice of the ROI.

What I'm trying to do next is to find a way or have someone write some back test strategy with the data, so I can run the strategy with more different variable to see if the results of outperforming is consistent, which may take some time.

**What do you think about such strategy? If you already buying SPY leaps consistently, what's your thesis behind it?**",1629787876

24,investing,"Dividend payouts to hit $1.4 trillion in 2021, nearing pre-pandemic levels, research shows","&gt;Key Points  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Samsung surpassed Nestle as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with Rio Tinto, Sberbank and Sanofi also making the top five.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dividends paid to investors are projected to hit $1.39 trillion in 2021, reflecting a recovery that’s stronger than expected, according to a new report from British asset manager Janus Henderson.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The 2021 forecast for dividends is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak, the firm found.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Janus Henderson projected that dividend payouts will return to pre-pandemic highs within the next 12 months.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of the growth was attributed to companies restarting frozen payouts and issuing higher special dividends on the back of strong earnings. Underlying dividend growth in the second quarter, stripping out the effects of special dividends and exchange rates, was 11.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Samsung](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined) surpassed [Nestle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NES.N-CH) as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with [Rio Tinto](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIO-GB), [Sberbank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FKRX300) and [Sanofi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAN-FR) also making the top five.  
&gt;  
&gt;Samsung distributed a total of $12.2 billion to investors once its regular dividend was included, and Janus Henderson anticipates that it will likely be among the world’s top five payers throughout 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The rebound has been so much stronger than we anticipated, and I think it is very encouraging that we are seeing these companies feeling strong enough to return cash back to shareholders,” Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager for global equity income at Janus Henderson, told CNBC on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Geographical divergence  
&gt;  
&gt;**Payouts in the U.K. surged 60.9%, and in Europe climbed 66.4%, while most of the dividend cuts were in emerging markets**, the report said, reflecting the delayed impact from lower reported 2020 profits. It said dividend cuts in developed markets were “pre-emptive and precautionary.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**North America, meanwhile, saw record dividends in the second quarter, driven by Canada. However, payouts in the region had largely held up through 2020, meaning there was little rebound effect.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In Asia-Pacific outside of Japan, headline dividend growth was 45% annually in the second quarter, buoyed by Samsung’s one-off special dividend, with South Korea and Australia leading growth in the region. However, Singapore remained constrained by restrictions on banking payouts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japanese dividend payments also remained robust in 2020, but still managed underlying growth of 11.9% year-on-year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In emerging markets, however, dividends fell 3.2% annually on an underlying basis, pulled down by lower 2020 profits, while just 56% of emerging market companies raised or held dividends steady in the second quarter.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Portfolio implications  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mining companies showed the fastest growth on the back of booming commodity prices, while industrials and consumer discretionary companies also bounced back strongly, the Janus Henderson research showed. So-called defensive sectors, such as telecoms, food and household products, maintained their characteristically consistent single-digit growth rates.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“In terms of the highest yielding sectors, the financial services and commodity sectors dividend outlooks are the most improved since last year,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.  
&gt;  
&gt;The firm has been adding to positions in these sectors in its equity allocations over the past 12 months in a bid to capitalize on this rebound. Many banks and financial services companies were subject to regulatory restrictions on dividend payments during the pandemic, which are now beginning to lift.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The travel and leisure sectors remain hardest hit in terms of the Covid impact, and while many have adjusted operations to be able to survive, the sector is unlikely to be paying dividends until balance sheets recover, so we continue to avoid these for the time being,” Lofthouse added.",1629734217

46,investing,Ratio Review: Price to Book,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries.

Pfizer recently went to push Amarin's drug Vascepa in Canada [Link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hls-therapeutics-announces-promotional-agreement-with-pfizer-for-vascepa-r-in-canada-861060988.html)

Only time will tell.

This coming week Amarin's drug Vascepa will be prestented at ESC congess on Aug 29th with results showing it pay help treat COVID patients. If you can, I suggest to go watch the results that day.

Also last moment to trade shares once the COVID treatment results comeout will be on the Frankfurt exchange.

Recent article below by Amarin's CEO below. Put in bold what he said was important.

Then, in March 2020, U.S federal courts invalidated several patents for Vascepa, opening the door to generic competition and potentially shrinking sales of the company’s once-promising drug.

Amarin’s stock price fell by 50% virtually overnight.

The court rulings could have been a death sentence for a company like Amarin. Instead, it has rebounded with a risky, unusually aggressive strategy for a small drugmaker that markets and sells a single pill.

Karim Mikhail, Amarin’s CEO and a 22-year veteran of Merck, said the company will launch sales of Vascepa next month in the European Union and plans to expand into Asia and Africa next year. The company also has added sales staff to battle generic drugmakers for U.S. sales.

“People who fought for the value that this product brings to the market are not letting go today,” he said. “They risked their careers … to prove a point that this product brings enormous benefit.”

It plans to thread the needle to profitability with overseas sales and fighting off U.S. generic competitors by pushing doctors to prescribe Vascepa to more heart patients. Here in the U.S., it must do so by selling a drug that on average costs 77% more than generics.

J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye still believes Vascepa will be successful, she said in investor notes, but sales will ramp up over 10 years.

This month, former Amarin CEO John Thero was succeeded by Mikhail, Merck’s former chief marketing officer in Europe and emerging markets. His appointment and the expansion of Amarin’s sales staff indicated the company plans to go it alone.

“Investors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near-term merger and acquisition on the table (which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock),” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a recent investor note.

Big pharmaceutical companies typically buy up startups to avoid the risk and expense of drug development. But companies like Amarin are rarely acquisition targets, according to studies by Michael Kinch, director of the Center for Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

Vascepa joins a long list of cardiovascular drugs over the past two decades dominated by blockbusters marketed by Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough and AstraZeneca.

The most commonly prescribed heart medicines are today available as low-cost generics. And generics typically capture 95% of the brand-name’s sales three months after generic drugs hits the market, according to Wall Street analysts.

The generic version of Vascepa, has not experienced that level of success.

Mikhail said Vascepa was notoriously difficult to manufacture and the raw ingredients difficult to acquire in bulk. “Clearly, the generics never thought they would win this case,” he said. “The evidence is they were not ready with supply.”

The FDA says Vascepa’s mechanism in action to reduce stroke and heart attacks is “not completely understood.” Amarin claims the drug has anti-inflammatory properties and it has announced several academic centers are studying Vascepa as a possible treatment for colorectal cancer as well as Covid.

Mikhail said preliminary Covid study data is scheduled for release next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

**“You look at what Covid patients die from, they mostly die because of an inflammatory storm,” he said. “If the study is positive, and it has value in delaying progression in Covid patients … that would be incredible.”**

**It would also give Amarin another escape hatch to deliver shareholder value.**",1629722600

96,investing,Rolling random 401k's into an IRA,"Hello guys,

I have a quick question about 3 401K's I have from some old jobs. I have 30k in a 401k from an old job (vested) and 2 other 401ks worth 5k and 5k (both didn't vest unfortunately). So 40k total.

I was going to leave the 5k plans alone, because they have been getting 18%-35% each year for the last 3-5 yrs. BUT I was under the impression that maybe putting them all together and 40k in an IRA would generate more money ""snowballing"" together vs starting with just the 30k + of course my 6k/yr contributions.

Also- note I wanted to do a ROTH IRA but since my 40k1's are pre-tax I elected to do a traditional IRA and maybe convert to ROTH in the near future. Just wanted to mention incase someone asked why not ROTH.

So to recap, my main question is, should I leave the 10k split between 2 different plans that are doing very very well (5K at UBS and 5k TSP) or add the 10k to my 30k, to make my new IRA 40k even. Wondering which strategy would theoretically give me the better odds.",1629678292

63,investing,$EAR Plummeting to low 20s - justified?,"I'm trying to understand the drastic drop they've seen and am curious if anyone else following this stock has some insights?

$EAR (Eargo Inc) is a hearing aid manufacturer that is ""disrupting"" the market by selling customizable hearing aids online. They aren't for extreme hearing loss, but seem to be a good solution for mid-to-mild hearing loss. Their calling card seems to be that their devices are almost invisible, comfortable, long charges (16+ hours, I believe), and the devices can be controlled from a smartphone or with 'gestures' that adapt to different settings. *I don't know anything about hearing aids, so I'm just going by what I've read from reviews and reddit.* 

They dropped quite a bit after Q1 earnings despite beating EPS estimates, then dropped again with a big EPS miss in Q2, despite 44% YoY growth in revenue. Subsequently, the price has dropped about 70% from their February high to $21.48 as of Friday's close.

Dropping after a big EPS miss is not surprising, but dropping this much seems like an overreaction unless I'm missing something. They would seem to have a lot in their favor:

* They just launched their newest device (Eargo 5) very late in Q2, so one would expect significant revenue lift in Q3 and into the holidays once they put a marketing push behind the new product.
* [Early reviews](https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html) on the new device have been strong as far as I can tell (overall their line of products seem to be well reviewed and very competitive on price). 
* On their Q2 presentation they alluded to making inroads with payer relationships. 
* Even without better payer coverage, [Biden's recent executive order](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/biden-order-takes-aim-at-high-cost-of-hearing-aids-calls-for-otc-sales/603114/) calling for OTC sales of hearing aids and directive towards fair pricing would seem to provide some future tailwinds for a company like Eargo, who is already significantly lower priced than higher end hearing aids. 
* The total TAM should be expanding. Its estimated that 17% of Gen Xers and 10% of Millennials [already experience some level of hearing loss](https://www.ameritasinsight.com/wellness/hearing/why-millennials-and-generation-z-employees-have-hearing-loss). It is naturally expected that those numbers will grow with age. A digitally-forward, stigma free hearing aid solution would seem like an ideal product for those generations.

68,investing,BABA earnings analysis and investment,"Moving all noise aside and concentrating primarily on a business as if it was not even a public company is what counts (E.g Buying a bakery, hairdresser salon or anything else that produces cash). This will help you genuinely value a business without emotion. 

The most important aspect of a business is its ability as to how much cash it can generate on UNLEVERAGED net tangible assets. 

Alibaba's business is a lot more complicated compared to a simple hairdresser business but if you really only only concentrate on one business and analyse it thoroughly you will come to a ballpark figure.
 You wiol find that all internet based companies operate on hardly any Tangible assets which will allow them to generate piles of cash without plowing a tonne of cash into it every year. 

Alibaba is one of those businesses that can produce without the need of a shitload of Tangible asset re-investment. 
If you really look into their balance sheet and their returns you will see that alibaba is an extraordinary business running on very little UNTA (Unleveraged net tangible assets).
 
I can go on all day but we'll take a rough approach to last year's true earnings (without the EBITDA, or adding back Stock back compensation to earnings) they produced roughly $18 billion (adding back some amortization of intangible assets and the anti-monopoly fine paid but not adding depreciation of PP&amp;E because eventually you will need to reinvest that amount or close to it). In my opinion alibaba required app. $33 billion to operate which is give us about a 55% return on capital employed. An outstanding return for a company of this magnitude, remember this company is investing heavily is R&amp;D.

If you minus all liquid/net assets(which do account for something in the long run) you are virtually buying this company's for approximately $370B

97,investing,[Theory] medical is the new tech,"We have seen massive growth in the tech industry since the 80's and especially since 2001. I believe general tech will start to slow (but not stop) its growth. There is definitely still room in certain tech areas, such as AI.

I believe as tech slows, we will see a repeat of the same growth in the medical sector. Likely spurred by the pandemic, I think the medical sector will begin growing rapidly with new treatments for many kinds of diseases being released over the coming couple decades.

It may be a good time to begin pivoting gains made in tech stocks into medical based stocks.

A California judge on Friday ruled that a 2020 ballot measure that exempted ride-share and food delivery drivers from a state labor law is unconstitutional as it infringed on the legislature’s power to set standards at the workplace.

Proposition 22 is unconstitutional as “it limits the power of a future Legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law”, which makes the entire ballot measure “unenforceable”, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch wrote in the ruling.

Gig economy companies including Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Instacart were pushing to keep drivers’ independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.

The ballot measure was meant to cement app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

Known as Proposition 22, it marked the culmination of years of legal and legislative wrangling over a business model that has introduced millions of people to the convenience of ordering food or a ride with the push of a button.",1629514163

*\[…\] it’s not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it’s so limited.*

*Co-Diagnostics certainly has been  doing a good job lately as it’s been growing earnings more than most  other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because  investors think this strong earnings performance might be less  impressive moving forward.*

*Shares in Co-Diagnostics are going to  need a lot more upward momentum to get the company’s P/E out of its  slump. Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you  should sell your stock isn’t sensible, however it can be a practical  guide to the company’s future prospects.*

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in  colored boxes above. For instance, to assess stock’s profitability,  Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want  the indicator’s value to be lower than in peers, as is the case with  Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).

In the next step, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net  Margin is calculated. Similar calculations are done for stock’s  Valuation, Growth and Health. The algorithm starts with Valuation score,  requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds with Profitability,  Growth and Health scores, each time requiring the score to be 50 or  higher. Finally, the mean value across all four areas of interest are  calculated. Only highest ranking stocks subjected to further manual  inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

### Definitions

**P/E** (Price to Earnings ratio): the ratio of a  company’s share (stock) price to the company’s earnings per share (EPS).  A high Price-Earning ratio indicates that investors are expecting  higher growth of company’s earnings in the future compared to companies  with a lower Price-Earning ratio. A low Price-Earning ratio may indicate  either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company  is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. The long-term  average P/E for the S&amp;P 500 is around 16x.

**P/B** (Price to Book ratio): compares a company’s  current market value to its book value (where book value is the value of  all assets owned by a company). Except in the case of a small minority  of companies, like property companies and investment trusts that are  asset-based, book values can bear little or no relationship to true  values of the companies. In many of today’s companies, their most  valuable assets are not shown on the balances sheet and are therefore  not necessarily reflected in the company’s book value (e,g, copyrights,  intellectual capital). Despite the limitations of the price-book ratio,  academic research has repeatedly shown that stocks with low price-book  ratios tend to outperform stocks with high price-book ratios in the  United States and other stock exchanges.

**EV/EBITDA**: a popular valuation multiple used to  determine the fair market value of a company. EV stands for Enterprise  Value, while EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization. A key advantage of EV/EBITDA is that it  is independent of the capital structure (i.e. the mixture of debt and  equity). Therefore this multiple can be used to compare companies with  different levels of debt. It also avoids the significant shortcoming of  the P/E ratio which can be materially affected by the level of leverage  in the company. As of Jan. 2020, the average EV/EBITDA for the S&amp;P  500 was 14.20. As a general guideline, an EV/EBITDA value below 10 is  commonly interpreted as healthy and above average by analysts and  investors.

**ROA** (Return On Assets): shows how profitable a  company’s assets are in generating revenue. It’s a useful number for  comparing competing companies in the same industry. The higher the ROA  number, the better, because the company is earning more money on less  investment. ROAs over 5 are generally considered good.

**ROE** (Return ON Equity): measures the profitability of  a business in relation to the equity. ROEs of at least 15–20 are  generally considered good. Whereas ROE compares net income to the net  assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets  alone, without deducting its liabilities. Sometimes an extremely high  ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity  because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high  ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income,  which indicates risk.

**Net Margin** (Net Profit Margin): Net profit margin or  net margin is the percentage of net income generated from a company’s  revenue. Net income is often called the bottom line for a company or the  net profit. It helps investors assess if a company’s management is  generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and  overhead costs are being contained. Net profit margin can be influenced  by one-off items such as the sale of an asset, which would temporarily  boost profits.

**EPS** (Earnings Per Share): calculated as net income  (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. The  resulting number serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability.  The higher a company’s EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.  What counts as a “good” EPS will depend on factors such as the recent  performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the  expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company  might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if  analysts were expecting an even higher number.

**Quick ratio**: a ratio between quickly available or  liquid assets and current liabilities. A company with a quick ratio of  less than 1 cannot currently fully pay back its current liabilities. In  general, the higher the ratio, the greater the company’s liquidity.

**Current ratio**: a liquidity ratio that measures  whether a company has enough resources to meet its short-term  obligations. It compares a firm’s current assets to its current  liabilities. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry.  In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be  better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates  that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current  ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company’s  current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not  efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing  facilities.

**D/E** (Debt to Equity ratio): used to evaluate a  company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s  total liabilities by its shareholder equity. In other words, it measures  the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt  versus wholy owned funds. Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a  company or stock with higher risk to shareholders. What counts as a  “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the  business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0  would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would  be considered risky.

**LTDebt/Eq** (Long Term Debt to Equity ratio):  calculated by taking the company’s long-term debt and dividing it by the  book value of common equity. Similar to D/E, but long term debt is  applied there (debt that matures in more than one year).

**PEG** (price/earnings to growth ratio): a valuation  metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a  stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company’s  expected growth. PEG is a widely employed indicator of a stock’s  possible true value. Similar to PE ratios, a lower PEG means that the  stock is undervalued more. It is favored by many over the price/earnings  ratio because it also accounts for growth. Criticisms of the PEG ratio  include that it is an oversimplified ratio that fails to usefully relate  the price/earnings ratio to growth because it fails to factor in return  on equity (ROE) or similar factors. On the other hand, the PEG ratio  can offer a suggestion of whether a company’s high P/E ratio reflects an  excessively high stock price or is a reflection of promising growth  prospects for the company.

**P/S** (Price to Sales ratio): a valuation ratio that  shows a company’s market capitalization divided by the company’s sales  for the previous 12 months. It is a measure of the value investors are  receiving from a company’s stock by indicating how much are they are  paying for the stock per dollar of the company’s sales. Analysts prefer  to see a lower number for the ratio. A ratio of less than 1 indicates  that investors are paying less than $1 per $1 of the company’s sales.  Any number higher than 4 is commonly considered unfavorable.

**Gross margin**: a difference between revenue and cost  of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. In other words, it is the  sales revenue a company retains after incurring the direct costs  associated with producing the goods it sells, and the services it  provides. The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company  retains on each dollar of sales, which it can then use to pay other  costs or satisfy debt obligations.

**Piotroski F-Score**: a discrete score between zero and  nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a  firm’s financial position. The Piotroski Score is used to determine the  best value stocks, with nine being the best and zero being the worst.

**Altman Z-Score**: the output of a credit-strength test  that gauges a publicly-traded manufacturing company’s likelihood of  bankruptcy. It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and  activity to predict whether a company has a high probability of becoming  insolvent. A score below 1.8 means it’s likely the company is headed  for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go  bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they  should buy or sell a stock if they’re concerned about the company’s  underlying financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock  if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling or shorting a  stock if the value is closer to 1.8.

**Div Yield** (Dividend Yield): a ratio (dividend/price)  that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative  to its stock price.

**Payout ratio**: a financial metric showing the  proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders in the form of  dividends, expressed as a percentage of the company’s total earnings.

**Beta**: a measure of a stock’s volatility in relation  to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&amp;P  500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according  to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than  the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than  the market, the stock’s beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are  supposed to be riskier but provide higher return potential; low-beta  stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.

**Volatility**: represents how large an asset’s prices swing around the mean price.

**MRQ**: Most Recent Quarter.

**TTM**: Trailing Twelve Months.

**Volume**: the total number of shares that are actually traded (bought and sold) during a period of time.

China´s interest on developing these natios is strong for both, political and economical reasons. 

It will take some time yes, but i think africa can play a major role as a solution for logistics disruptions we are facing today in logistics; just think about the position in the map they play. Really it is pretty near of every major major market

I used the data for ARKK and simulated how the average investor in ARKK would have fared compared with investing in a Total Market ETF.

I imported every daily net fund flow in [Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/) and invested it into VTI or ARKK based on historic prices from yahoo finance.

I didn't include any Dividends. However that doesn't change much because most of the fund flows occurred in the last two years.

The annualized true time weighted rate of return  for ARKK is a very high 28.1% compared with 11.6% for the Total Market. However the average dollar invested in ARKK did worse than if it were invested into a total market ETF.

The IRR for ARKK is 21.6% while the IRR for VTI is 25.1%.

36,investing,New home construction has soared to its highest level since July 2007,"[https://www.axios.com/home-construction-levels-dc2bd3ac-3b36-43e2-b24e-bd686c09f3d3.html](https://www.axios.com/home-construction-levels-dc2bd3ac-3b36-43e2-b24e-bd686c09f3d3.html)

 

&gt;The number of new homes under construction has soared — to levels not seen since the housing market crash 14 years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why it matters:** Home prices have been [surging](https://www.axios.com/consumers-complain-high-prices-inflation-2143e88c-84a3-4908-9861-8dd1571636dd.html) as the demand for houses has [outpaced supply](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html). Homebuilders are doing what they can to keep up, but supply chain bottlenecks have led some to [turn away buyers](https://www.axios.com/home-sales-construction-demand-dr-horton-805c6f47-c8c4-46ee-96a6-3b0fcd330365.html) as they try to catch up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Driving the news:** There were 689,000 single-family homes [under construction](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html) in July, the highest number since July 2007.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This  is clearly a positive sign given the remarkably low levels of inventory  on the market,"" Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike  Fratantoni says.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Yes, but:** While the large  number likely means more new homebuyers will soon be able to move in, it  may also reflect the fact that it’s taking increasingly [longer](https://nahbnow.com/2021/08/builder-confidence-at-13-month-low-on-higher-material-costs-home-prices/) to complete a home.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I  expect there have been delays in construction, and that is why there  are so many ‘under construction,'"" Bill McBride, housing economist at  Calculated Risk, tells Axios.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The lack of building materials,  ready-to-build on lots, and labor shortages are slowing housing growth,""  Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda Economics, tells Axios.  
&gt;  
&gt;This explains why the number of homes under construction is up even as the [pace of housing starts slows](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-housing-starts-fall-sharply-july-2021-08-18/).  
&gt;  
&gt;**State of play:** As of June, [new homes](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)  were being sold at an annualized rate of 676,000, a number that’s come  down from a high of 993,000 in January due to supply constraints.  
&gt;  
&gt;An unusually high [76.6%](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html) of new homes sold were either still under construction or not yet started.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the supply of new homes has been ticking higher, completed homes represented a [record low](https://twitter.com/RenMacLLC/status/1419668494816264193) 10.2% of this supply.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The big picture:** It may be tempting to draw comparisons to the housing bubble, but that may be a mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Builders  adjust their sales strategy depending on where the market is,"" Wolf  explains. ""For example, during the mid-2000s housing boom, builders  started a lot of speculative building to get ahead of the demand.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Following  the crash, builders pivoted more towards a built-to-order model where  they would wait for a buyer to start most of their homes,"" she says.  ""The high number of homes under construction is partly telling us that  builders are building homes that they already have under contract.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**The bottom line:**  While the elevated level of construction raises warning flags, evidence  suggests it is more reflective of delays than frenzied speculative  building.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Since most of these are already sold, I don't think we are overbuilding, or that this will impact prices,"" McBride says.",1629462652
42,investing,What do you think will be the largest company in the world by 2050?," 

\- Does it even exist yet?

\- What industry are they in?

\- Why will they be the largest?

I think Tesla, I know, original but everything points in that way for the company. They are growing at an astounding rate despite their size and are still looking to increase production of there vehicles 50% yoy for at least the next decade. Which would put them around 20 Mil by 2030.

That's just the surface, Elon has publicly stated that be believes that the energy side of Tesla's business (solar, batteries, etc) will be worth the same if not more then the automotive side.

I don't think that will be the most exciting part of tesla's business and today it was confirmed. The AI component of Tesla's business (self driving cars/robotics) will be the largest of them all. Ark invest projects that global revenue for autonomous cars and services could exceed 10 trillion by 2035, and I think Tesla will have a outsized chunk of this pie.

As a Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate, the things I see this company producing are just beyond astonishing, go watch Sandy Munro talk about Tesla's innovation, watch battery day and AI day and tell me that this won't be the biggest company in the world. They are innovating on things other companies have barely started and are doing at an accelerating rate.

From an investment standpoint it's a no brainer.

Just Imagine,

\- creating your own AI chip in house because NIVDIA's are not good enough

\- creating your own batteries in house because Panasonic's are not good enough

\- creating a new alloy so you can megacast half of the structure of a car in 10ms

64,investing,How does this sub feel about TDOC,"
Initially held LVGO shares, that got acquired by TDOC. May be should have gotten out at that point, but that's hindsight.. TDOC is down quite a bit this year from all time high of ~300. I plan to hold it for couple years, but not sure if that's a good decision. Inputs? Not sure if average down is a good idea either.. looks like membership growth is not quite encouraging.

Last week saw the newest second-quarter earnings release from Teladoc Health, Inc. ( NYSE:TDOC ). The company posted revenues in line with expectations, at US$503m, while statutory losses ballooned to US$0.86 per share.

Teladoc is mitigating the expenses caused by the acquisition of Livongo Health, Inc. around a year ago. Net loss was US$(333.5)m for the first half of 2021 compared to US$(55.3)m for the first half of 2020. The second quarter and first half of 2021 include stock-based compensation expense of US$83m and US$169.3m, respectively, an increase of US$61m and US$129m, respectively, from the second quarter and first half of 2020, substantially reflecting higher expense associated with Livongo stock awards that continue to vest after the merger.

Their crown jewel is their 70 year relationship with the MLB for an exclusive license to brand their baseball carsd. While its possible to make baseball cards without the branding (a competitor, Panini, does this), it certainly is a major part of their value add. 

Topps reported big earning beats yesterday, but it was just leaked today that they had lost their exclusive MLB branding contract, and their current contract expires in 2026. Baseball cards make up roughly half of the revenues of Topps and is one of their most profitable business units. The news caused shares to nosedive ahead of the proposed merger that would take Topps public. For such a material change in business, is it typically worthwhile to cut losses no matter what the current market price is due to the change in fundamentals?

86,investing,"Regenerative medicine nears banner year with $14.1B cash infusion, regulatory milestones and a well-stocked pipeline","For a long time, gene and cell therapies were a treatment option for the future. Now, the pace of development is moving at breakneck speed, with a number of firsts and $14.1 billion in financing collected over the initial half of the year.

The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine has documented the “acceleration on all fronts” in a new report looking at the first half of 2021.

Most notably was Intellia’s demonstration of CRISPR gene-editing in humans through phase 1 data for patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. But that’s not all for regenerative medicine, which includes cell and gene therapies, gene editing and tissue-based therapies.

Companies developing these therapies have collected $14.1 billion in the first half alone, which is 71% of what was raised during all of 2020. The alliance called this surge the strongest half on record. 2020 already broke financing records, with $20 billion, and the report suggests 2021 could exceed that total.

Cell-based immuno-oncology has for the first time surpassed gene therapy in financing, notching $6.6 billion compared to $6.4 billion, respectively. The broader category of cell therapy, including stem cell treatments for Parkinson's disease, meanwhile picked up $1.1 billion.

Regulatory milestones

Gene therapies and gene-modified cell therapy products are on track to notch the highest annual number of regulatory approvals. Three have already been approved. Bluebird bio’s Skysona nabbed an EU nod for the rare neuromuscular disease cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird’s multiple myeloma CAR-T drug Abecma was cleared by the FDA in late March. And Bristol Myers’ long-awaited CAR-T liso-cel, now called Breyanzi, was approved in February.

Waiting in the regulatory queue in the U.S. and EU is Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Bio’s cilta-cel in multiple myeloma, which will compete with Abecma. Other companies have approvals pending around the world.

Even with these approvals, however, cell and gene therapies face hurdles once they are cleared for the market. Bluebird bio, for instance, has pulled back from European markets after failing to reach a consensus on pricing for the one-time treatment Zynteglo.

The pipeline is nevertheless filled to the brim with new therapies. The report counted 1,320 industry-sponsored trials underway worldwide, including 158 that are in phase 3. Academic and other research is responsible for an additional 1,328 non-industry trials including 85 late-stage studies.

Indications run the gamut of diseases, but are mostly concentrated in oncology for the industry-sponsored trials, followed by central nervous system (CNS) disorders and rare genetic diseases. Academic research similarly focuses on oncology, followed by infectious diseases and CNS.

CAR-T therapies, which take a patients’ own cells and power them up to fight cancer before being returned to the body, have been particularly dominate in R&amp;D. Abecma is one example, but the J&amp;J-Legend cilta-cel showed some promising data in June, with a 98% overall response rate in multiple myeloma. The therapy is currently being reviewed by EU and U.S. regulators, with a decision expected later this year.


More readouts are expected from Precision BioSciences and CRISPR Therapeutics, which are working on separate BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapies.

The alliance counts 566 companies as developing regenerative medicines and advanced therapies in the U.S. and 588 industry-sponsored trials with U.S. sites.

One of the sayings of David Gardner of The Motley Fool. If youre a day trader or short term investor you need to remember that the stock market ALWAYS goes down

Seriously. You can take that and test it. By any stock. Any of them. And nine times out of 10 no matter when you bought it- will be in the red by the end of the week

Stocks always go down. They say not to buy high and sell low but you're always buying high. At any moment you're buying a stock higher than it will be later in that week.. because in the short term they always go down. So it's impossible NOT to buy a stock high

And in many cases impossible not to sell it low. There's plenty of examples of a stock that never goes back up no matter how long you hold it. Look at tesla. It was steadily increasing for months until it hit $840 before it dropped. For anyone trying to follow the ""advice"" of ""just hold it"" instead of cutting their losses they would have lost tons of money and it never went back up..

More examples how it's impossible not to buy high and often times impossible not to sell low

The only times you can actually make money is if you hold it for a very long time. And being that it's impossible to beat the market you generally won't see that much rate of return. Unless you prove to be a better investor than the experts at Wall Street then the chances of making any serious money unless you already invested serious money would be pretty low. You have to have at least a few million dollars in the stock market to reliably make anything tangible..",1629395334

Recent news- GoHealth and GoodRx Announce Exclusive Medicare Agreement

CHICAGO and SANTA MONICA, Calif., Aug. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GoHealth, Inc. (GoHealth) (NASDAQ: GOCO), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, and GoodRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX), America's leading resource for healthcare savings, today announced an exclusive agreement to bring GoHealth's Medicare enrollment and engagement solutions directly to GoodRx users on the GoodRx platform.

Of the nearly 20 million people who come to GoodRx every month looking for savings, millions of them have Medicare, based on GoodRx's internal analysis, while many others qualify for the program each year as they age in. GoodRx consumers who want to explore Medicare coverage options and understand potential benefits or savings will be able to access information about GoHealth's market-leading Medicare plan selection solutions. Those who enroll in a Medicare plan through GoHealth have access to a suite of healthcare services to further improve health outcomes. For instance, GoHealth members will receive ongoing engagement and education around pharmacy options and prescription savings related to their Medicare Advantage plan to maximize the value of their prescription plan benefits.

GoHealth consumers will also have access to GoodRx prescription discounts on GoHealth's Encompass platform. GoodRx prescription discounts can provide savings of up to 80% from the pharmacy retail price and are accepted at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, including Albertsons, CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Walmart and Walgreens.

""We're excited to bring GoodRx into GoHealth's robust ecosystem of strategic partners. Prescription costs are a major financial barrier for many people, especially Medicare members, and GoodRx's platform is greatly beneficial to finding savings for our members. Through this strategic partnership, we are giving our members affordable choices to further improve health outcomes, while also helping GoodRx's users find and enroll in the right Medicare coverage plan that fits their needs, a real win-win,"" said Ben Miller, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships at GoHealth.

GoodRx is one of the many strategic partners GoHealth has added to its Encompass technology, a proprietary engagement platform that maximizes members' utilization of their benefits once enrolled in a plan, ensuring that members receive the care they need. This agreement is part of GoHealth's ongoing commitment to improve access to healthcare in America.

""The strategic partnership with GoHealth adds critical information to our platform that helps users as they seek to understand and navigate the complex world of Medicare,"" said Doug Hirsch, co-CEO and co-founder of GoodRx. ""The level of Medicare expertise and service that GoHealth provides, combined with our prescription savings value proposition, creates immense value all around.""

**Quote from the recent Earnings report**

Clint Jones, co-founder and CEO said, ""GoHealth's second quarter revenue growth of 55% was driven by an 84% gain in our Medicare—Internal segment with LTVs expanding 5%. Our ramped up investments in our Encompass Platform led to $17 million in revenue contribution from the platform's additional services beyond enrollment for carriers. Given the 50% top-line growth over the first six months and continued strength in the market, **we have raised and tightened our revenue expectations for full year fiscal 2021.""**

61,investing,Your input on the evaluation of successful firms in strong bearish times,"Hi all,
 
I have a question that I can’t wrap my head around. It is with regards to a fair (I know it’s subjective tho) evaluation of a firm in difficult times.
 
Let’s take Biontech. Currently P/E in the 10s?! They will reap billions over the next years from COVID vaccines and their technology will likely lead to other innovations so let’s assume they grow 15% annually over the next 10 years. Their P/E would be around the same, maybe 20 (other indicators deem a fair valuation too) all that time.
 
In 6 years the markets crash for whatever reason and because everything does, so does the stock price of Biontech. But people still have diseases and revenue comes in. 
 
If the price plunges 50% with stable earnings/revenues……Would you agree with my conclusions:
 
1)     Biontech would be subject to an overcorrection leading to an undervaluation (P/E would be even lower), therefore likely to bounce back to some degree
2)     However the bounce back would only happen, if the markets loose the irrational emotions and stop panic selling. When that is over, the market will see the undervaluation and buy the stock
 
BUT: I just wonder for how long that could go. Is it possible, or being more precise, are there known examples where the markets have been low for a long time and with that the value of firms who do exceptionally well? That would be irrational.

I am asking since it makes sense to me to hold Biontech long term…10-15 years surely. But if a crash would come around and drag Biontech with it, I rather sell and take profits instead of buying the dips…because of the risk (however real that risk would be?!) that it takes forever to bounce back….
 
Hope this made sense and I am grateful for your thoughts.",1629380659

The crackdown wiped off nearly $1 trillion of market value from Chinese shares listed globally last month as it quickly expanded from antitrust and e-commerce concerns to private tutoring, data security and online content. Alibaba’s shares have slumped 29% this year compared to a fall of just under 7% for the Hang Seng Index. 

The selloff has prompted some global fund managers including Cathie Wood to dump their holdings in Chinese stocks over the past few months. In fact, some investors are questioning allocations toward Chinese assets altogether.

The new moves are incremental but investors are not at a point where they “will cease to price in any more additional policies,” said Shine Gao, fund manager at Taicheng Capital Management Co. “Even if the worst is over for big tech firms in terms of new regulations, we should expect that their growth won’t be what it was.”

""The TFD Initiative, whose members include major global financial institutions and leading service providers such as ABN AMRO, Santander Asset Management, ING Bank, SMBC, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Texel Group, NN Investment Partners and more, recognises the vital role blockchain will play in shaping the future of the trade finance sector, which has already been successfully implemented in other areas of finance.

A first-of-its-kind, public-private hybrid blockchain platform, XDC Network brings energy-efficient smart contract and digital asset technology to the trade investment class.

Chris Southworth, Secretary General, ICC United Kingdom who is an observer on TFD Initiative said: ""Trade finance is a compelling asset class for institutional investors. Making trade finance more accessible for non-bank investors is of paramount importance if we are going to drive the economic recovery from Covid and fill the USD 3-5 trillion SME trade finance gap. Innovative technology driven solutions like the TFD Initiative are a critical part of the solution to providing more liquidity into the market.""

Leveraging the power of cryptographic tokens, the XDC Network allows for the digitisation, tokenisation, and swift settlement of trade transactions, reducing reliance on complex foreign exchange infrastructures. Some of the key advantages include lower transaction fees (near zero), less energy consumption, efficient confirmation time, double validation, and randomisation for security guarantees.""",1629296053

39,investing,My Thoughts On The NFT Craze,"  

Today as I sipped my coffee in my backyard I was keeping my ear to the streets as I normally do in the latest financial gossip. I’ve recently heard about the new craze that is seemingly lingering longer than I thought it would. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are being ushered into the millennial and zoomer populations by creatively bankrupt Hollywood has-beens and noteworthy celebrities. Lindsay Lohan and other bold innovators of the investor class like Soulja Boy and Mark Cuban. Both of them are well known for their reliable and professional investment advice and business savvy. Cuban who has recently been an avid promoter of the Wallstreet bets pump and dump movement and Soulja Boy who was recently sued by Nintendo over his cheap Chinese knock-off video game consoles violated more than a dozen copyright laws. 

Honestly, my first impression of these NFT’s is a bit on the cynical side. Perhaps it is just my overactive imagination paired with a sense of dark humor. But I truly see people buying these NFT’s as a sign of the apocalypse. The concept wasn’t totally foreign to me. Video gamers have been using digital inventory for real-world currency for a long time. Online communities tend to have websites that facilitate in real-world trade of money for in-game items or digital loot drops from other players. Online trading card games have had digital copies of rare cards that are commonly traded for money too. Online party hats in a video game called Runescape sold for 7 thousand USD between private sellers. But are we really at a stage in the economic cycle where the best course of action is to buy digital content to pad your portfolio? 

Are we really at a moment in history where people are actually purchasing a Lindsey Lohan NFT for 17 thousand dollars? Is dancing GIFS of Mark Cuban to your portfolio really going to be a solid item for your child’s financial future? Will AMC one day let us pay for our movies with Zuckerberg GIFs or pre-expulsion Trump Tweets? Will canceled celebrities have to sell their NFTs in shady alleys and on street corners within flash drives? I don’t truly know and I don’t want to pretend to know the answer. While it’s really easy to cherry-pick from the dregs of the Hollywood influencer types. There is real money being moved by major players in the digital market. A GIF of a cat-poptart hybrid called “Nyan-Cat” sold for 450 thousand dollars and Kings of Leon’s album sold for 6 million dollars respectively. 

In both instances, the content is already released to the public. The owners don’t collect any revenue or royalties anytime the GIFs are used or the albums are played. In fact, the only thing gained is a sense of ownership within our digital world. While the world stands on the brink of opening up, the flood of money into online and virtual assets is staggering. Why buy real estate when you can buy virtual real estate? There was an old saying by Mark Twain. “Buy land, they aren’t making any more of it.” I can’t help but reflect on that as I see more and more of the virtual space be paved. How much farther into technology is society really trying to dive in and how much are people really willing to invest into this frontier? 

On one level this seems to be a desperate attempt for people with influence to make money from their followers by truly trying to offer them the clout of virtual asset ownership instead of conventionally making products to sell to them. On another level, this is pop culture and pop art manifesting its own free market. I don’t believe the Government will get involved yet in a major capacity on either side of the pendulum either. I think the government trying to restrict the sale of virtual art is about as likely as them releasing their own NFTs of what’s within area 51 or who killed JFK. 

But on another level, I also think that NFTs are a way where people can support their content creators and help support them in more meaningful ways beyond a tip. Instead of donations and handouts, people are now able to get collectibles and memorabilia that might hold and maintain some value as opposed to nothing. We live in a world where artists and entertainers stream a variety of content to their fans and audiences. The idea that the words we utter, the pictures we take, and our online memories can all be bought and sold are a new chapter in this digital economy. In today’s day and age, you’re money.",1629253205

I'm in a situation with a masters program application a couple months from now where I'll need to prove I have a certain amount of money via a bank statement. Basically since tuition is free in this country (Norway) they require you to provide bank statements showing that you have enough money to support yourself (they won't accept brokerage accounts). I have more than enough money saved and invested, I just don't want to make a taxable event by selling assets simply to get cash in my account, pull a statement, and then put it right back in the brokerage. An alternative I found sounds tempting: withdraw contributions from my Roth IRA, get it in my checking account temporarily, then put it right back in the Roth. From what I've read, this is considered a ""rollover"" into the same account and is okay with the IRS so long as it's returned within 60 days. So my question is, is this a reasonable alternative to get cash in my account temporarily, or is there something I'm missing that may bite me in the ass?

Disclaimer: I know someone will say that I should sell the assets now if I intend to use them in the near future, and you're not wrong. But at my current savings rate I will have the required amount saved by the time I need it, and I'd rather have this money keep working for me in the meantime.

If you did not know a Series EE bonds is suppose to double in value in 20 years. The rates are pretty low for these bonds. The earliest bonds I have is 1996 going all the way to 2011. Some bonds are close to maturity where others basically have very little interest. Final Maturity for a 2011 bond is around 2041 meaning ill be 45 years old. An example I have is a bond at face value of $250 in 2011, after going to irs.gov it is valued at $265ish after 10 years. 
I calculated the overall cash value of my bonds as of today is around $6,800. Which could really help buy a property. 

My overall question is should I cash my bonds and put it all towards a down payment? Seems that id make more money generating income from a property over the long term.

22,investing,The Biggest Misconception about Investing,"I posted this the other day on r/StockMarket and r/ValueInvesting got wonderful responses so I thought I’d share it here too. Now, I understand that some of you may have already seen this if you follow either subs (I couldn’t post here because I didn’t have enough karma). I share it fully acknowledging that fact. Nonetheless, I do think some of the points below can be beneficial for some people.

## Key points:

* A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they’re really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.
* Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.
* Invest like a landlord. If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter I recommend using owner’s earnings. After all, they are your earnings.
* Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have extremely capable and smart people literally making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!

## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing

The investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise &amp; misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth.

## What is investing?

Investing is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments — stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.

## What investing is not

Investing is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more [foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT) to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing — a recipe for disaster.

Likewise, statements such as “the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or ""Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy"" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.

Investing in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up nor is it some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.

## Become a landlord

To become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don’t sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.

And the best part? You don’t have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing and, selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are reported automatically, you don’t have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. Why would you not invest if every time Apple sold an iPhone, a percentage of that money goes to you?!

*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*

## Many people speculate, few invest

Investing is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends to ""long-term investors"" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the ""future"" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.

Instead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.

However, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this [chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800) says it all\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not. Let me know if you’re interested.

*Also, if any of you can suggest which other subs could benefit from this post, please let me know. I’d love to engage in a conversation across multiple subs.*",1629204002

Here’s how the company did for its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

\- Earnings per share: $4.53 vs. $4.44 expected

\- Revenue: $41.12 billion vs. $40.79 billion expected

For the three months ended Aug. 1, net income grew to $4.81 billion, or $4.53 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for $4.44 per share, according to a Refinitiv survey.

Revenue climbed 8.1% to $41.12 billion from $38.05 billion a year earlier. That topped expectations for $40.79 billion.

Total same-store sales rose 4.5%. That was short of the more than 5% growth anticipated from analysts polled by StreetAccount.

The company reported a 5.8% drop in customer transactions compared with a year earlier, but the average ticket was 11.3% larger. Sales per retail square foot grew 5.3% year over year to $663.05.

Inflation could be one factor boosting sales. Analysts say lumber prices peaked during the latest quarter.

Home Depot faces tough comparisons with a year earlier when its brick-and-mortar stores remained open during the pandemic, and many Americans invested in remodelling projects. Home Depot’s revenue growth is expected to slow in 2021.",1629199437

43,investing,Michael Burry just unveiled a new short bet against Cathie's Wood's Arkk innovation ETF,"Michael Burry is the latest investor to reveal a bet against the ETF, according to Scion Asset Management's second-quarter 13F filing. Burry initiated the new position by buying $31 million worth of puts in the ARKK ETF.

Burry's not the only one, as the Disruptive Innovation ETF has a 30-day put-to-call ratio of 1.8, meaning more people are buying bearish put options on the fund than bullish call options.

Other investors are outright shorting shares of the ETF, with short interest currently sitting at a record high 11.63%, according to data from Koyfin. With 21.58 million shares sold short as of Friday, the bet against ARK Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF now totals $2.6 billion. 		

Burry's bet against ARK is likely tied to his conviction that Tesla is a short, given that Scion Asset Management's largest position is a $731 million put position in the electric vehicle manufacturer, representing a whopping 35% of his fund's more than $2 billion in assets under management. Burry increased his bet against Tesla by 34% in the second-quarter. 

Tesla remains Ark Invests largest position by a significant margin, with it making up nearly 11% of the ARKK ETF as of Friday. 

The ARKK ETF is down 7% year-to-date, but up 38% over the past year. The ETF was down about 3% on Monday.

China’s market regulator issued draft rules on Tuesday aimed at stopping unfair competition on the internet, as Beijing continues its broad crack down on the country’s technology sector.

The rules published by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) cover a wide range of areas from prohibitions on the way companies can use data to stamping out fake product reviews.

Chinese listed technology stocks in Hong Kong fell sharply on that news. Gaming giant Tencent was 3.5% lower in late morning trade, while e-commerce giant Alibaba fell 2.5%.

SAMR’s latest rules continue Beijing’s regulatory assault on China’s technology giants.

Here are some of the other key rules outlined:

Operators should not provide false data, such as the number of clicks on a piece of content;
Operators should not conceal negative reviews and only promote positive reviews;
Internet platforms should not use data, algorithms and other technical means to influence user choices, or other methods to carry out so-called traffic hijacking. This is where a company looks to redirect a user to their own website or service while they’re browsing another;
Operators should not use data and algorithms to collect and analyze competitors’ trading information.
SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

The regulator is seeking public opinion on the new rules until Sept. 15. They have not yet come into effect.

However, SAMR’s draft rules highlight the market regulator’s push to tighten the laws around antitrust and competition. Earlier this year, the authority promulgated antitrust guidelines for the so-called platform economy.

The regulator has also been taking action against China’s technology giants.

Alibaba was slapped with a $2.8 billion fine in April as a result of an anti-monopoly probe, and SAMR is currently investigating food delivery firm Meituan for “suspected monopolistic practices.”

And last month, the SAMR blocked Tencent’s plan to merge video game streaming sites Huya and DouYu on antitrust concerns.",1629182049
58,investing,[HELP] me identify this scam! Or is it not a scam? Too good to be true!,"Few months ago my friend was referred to this broker through another friend. The broker is Dave Clarkson (working for an investment firm called [The Investment Center](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/), UK).

She sent him $5,000 3 months ago and he helped set her up a Binance account, which he manages. She also has access to this Binance account. Today she has hit $15,000 on that account. I was stumped at this 300% return so on questioning her further she says that almost everybody who is investing through this broker, which is a majority of her friend group, is making massive returns.

For example, one of her close friends took a loan of $40,000 at the start of this year, and is now regularly withdrawing $20,000 every month since past 3 months.

Another close friend of hers in the same friend group is profiting more than $100,000 a year through Dave Clarkson.

She said I should invest too, so I started doing my due research online. I found out they are not registered with [FCA UK](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/investment-center).

Using my web development background, I found there are 2 other exactly similar websites to the [Investment Center UK website](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/) (just different branding):

1. [Walton Chase](https://waltonchase.com/)
2. [Top Market Cap](https://topmarketcap.com/)

And the [reviews for Walton Chase](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/waltonchase.com) do not look so good. 

Red flags I can identify:

1. The above reviews for Walton Chase (which seems like the same firm)
2. My friend sent me the UK phone number of Walton Chase - his profile picture is just a stock bitcoin image.
3. I cannot find much on the internet if i google for Dave Clarkson, or his phone number or about The Investment Center.
4. They are now calling her almost twice every week asking to invest more money.
5. On some posts on the internet I can see that they claim they have 20 years of experience in the investment sector, but their website was only active since March 2020 (using Way Back Machine).
6. 300% return in 3 months !

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed this with my friend and she has discussed with her other friends, and they think that as these are very high risk investments, they have very high returns, and also very high chances of losing the investment. So people who lose their investments end up posting bad reviews online. My friend and her friend group are not really convinced this is a scam and want to keep investing.

I am not into the world of investing much myself. I do have a ""safe"" VGS ETF, so my friend obviously think I know nothing about these ""high return"" investments.

2. 25%: **The Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index** (Commodity Futures, precious metals)

5. 20%: **The Bloomberg Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked 1-10 Year Bond Index** (TIPS) 

This seems like a decent inflation protection fund. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.23%. I'm not sure how expense ratios work, but I would guess that means there's the also the expense ratios behind these 5 funds as well? So the overall expense ratio might actually be a lot more?

I have 70% in US Stock Index (55% SP500, 15% small/mid cap index), 20% in international, and 10% in this ""Real Asset Fund"".

I rather not keep cash in a retirement account with an employee match. And I don't know how I feel about bonds right now. This ""Real Asset Fund"" seems to be good value and serve as an inflation hedge. I really have no other options to add other than a bond index fund or a cash fund.",1629163398

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ, August 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components and operator of GunBroker.com, the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 ended June 30, 2021.

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 versus First Quarter Fiscal 2021:**

●Net revenues increased 360% year-over-year to $44.5 million ●Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the acquisition of GunBroker.com ●Gross profit margin was 42.7% compared to 11.1% ●Net income was $9.5 million compared to a net loss of $3.1 million ●Diluted EPS of $0.08 compared to ($0.07); Adjusted EPS of $0.13 compared to ($0.01) ●Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million versus a loss of $0.3 million ●Backlog of $238 million

“We delivered solid first quarter results, exceeding estimates for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Core ammunition sales were up more than three-fold reflecting strong underlying demand for our unique, high-performance products. We also added over $12 million of high-margin Marketplace revenue with the GunBroker.com acquisition that closed in April,” said Fred Wagenhals, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMMO, Inc. “Integration efforts are advancing on schedule and we are working on several major initiatives to further accelerate growth across our powerful Marketplace platform. Construction of our new manufacturing facility is also on track and we continue to make progress with new product development and government contracts. I am very proud of our team’s commitment and execution in driving significant value for all stakeholders.”

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results**

Net revenues of $44.5 million were up 360% versus last year driven by strong growth in Ammunition and incremental revenue from the acquisition of GunBroker.com. Ammunition sales totaled $28.4 million compared to $6.4 million in last year’s first quarter, an increase of 342%. Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the GunBroker.com business we acquired on April 30, 2021.

Gross profit was $19.0 million in the first quarter versus $1.1 million in the year-earlier period due to the increased sales of Ammunition coupled with the addition of our Marketplace segment, which included GunBroker.com. Gross profit margin was 42.7% in the first quarter compared to 11.1% in last year’s first quarter reflecting the impact of our higher margin Marketplace revenue.

Operating expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $3.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase was attributable to operating the GunBroker.com business for approximately two months, higher commission payments stemming from growth in our Ammunition sales, higher stock-based compensation expense, and professional fees related to the acquisition of GunBroker.com. As a percent of sales, operating expenses declined to 20.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from 40.0% in the year-earlier period reflecting operating leverage, manufacturing scale and the mix shift in favor of higher margin Marketplace revenues.

Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $9.7 million compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million in last year’s first quarter.

Net income was $9.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.2 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share versus a net loss of $3.1 million and ($0.07) per fully diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income per share was $0.13 in versus an adjusted per share loss of ($0.01).

Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.3 million a year earlier.

**Outlook**

We are increasing our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance from $190 million to $210 million, including reiterating our expectation for second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue of at least $51 million. We estimate third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue will be approximately $60 million. We are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2022 from $65 million to $70 million.",1629159858

Let’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.

As discussed in this video: [https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4](https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4)

\&gt; \[Interviewer\]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?

\&gt; \[Dr Quay\] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.

\*\*What is 505(b)(2) ?\*\*

The 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.

28,investing,Do you think people will stick to their plans and continue to invest in to the S&amp;P500 even in a (multi) decade long bear market?,"When a young person asks here where he/she should invest a significant portion of the wage, the answer in this sub is often to dollar cost average every month in to an S&amp;P 500 ETF no matter what the market is doing.

The theory is, that with this strategy you would have made a good return in almost any given period of time over 30 years in the recent US Stockmarket history.

However, if a (multi) decade long bear market happens (and stock markets all over the world proved, that such things do happen), this requires to keep investing, even though you will have to take continuously losses over a very long time.

Do you think average retail investors have the patience and physiological strength to takes losses over such a long time, watching losing money month over month and stil keep investing or is this just a strategy which sounds good in theory but mostly doesn't work in practice?",1629141084

55,investing,US government opens probe into Tesla Autopilot crashes with emergency vehicles,"The Verge: https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a probe into Tesla’s Autopilot software, citing the cars’ repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles.

The NHTSA investigation will cover Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3 vehicles released from 2014 through 2021. The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.

The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.

AN NHTSA SPOKESPERSON REMINDED THE PUBLIC THAT NO COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES
A spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.

The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told Wired in 2018 that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.

Wired’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”

The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional.

In April, senators urged the NHTSA to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency issued new rules requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.",1629125803

11,investing,Discover Financial Services (DFS),"**Overview:**

Discover Financial Services operates in two distinct segments direct banking and payment services. Most of us are familiar with their credit card services but they also offer debit cards, money market accounts, loans, and etc. They are the 4th largest payment network in the US and own the largest ATM network in the US (Pulse).

**Valuation overview:**

MC = 40B

PE &lt; 9

PEG &lt; 1

current ratio &gt; 1

cash/debt = 0.8

EV/EBITDA &lt; 6

Looking at their competitors in the payment services the valuation metrics are attractive, and the market cap is significantly lower.

**DCF:**

conservative: Using the 8yr FCF average, 8% FCF growth over the next 5 years, and 4% terminal growth, I get a 16% IRR.

hopeful: Using the 3yr FCF average, 9% FCF growth over the next 5 years, and 5% terminal growth, I get a 19% IRR.

If you look at the FCF over the past 8yrs, it has been consistently growing.

Seems like a good value play. I'm curious on what I'm missing.

The stock has been on a run in the past year which does concern me, but, looking at the current valuation and growth it still look like a good investment.",1629076747

34,investing,My 10-week report of auto investing platforms (mostly robo),"TLDR: Invested in a range of automatic investing platforms (mostly robo-advisors). Made everything aggressive (100% stocks if possible). Every 10-12 weeks I'm switching out the worst performing for something new.

First 10 week results:

1. Titan: **+7.03%**
2. SoFi: **+4.19%**
3. M1 ""Social Responsibility"" Pie: **+4.07%**
4. M1 ""Ultra Aggressive"" Pie: **+3.01%**
5. Wealthfront: **+1.5%**
6. Betterment: **+1.31%**
7. SigFig: **-.34%**

In that same time period, popular ETFs performed pretty well:

* VTI had a **4.25%** increase (Total stock market)
* VOO had a **4.41%** increase (S&amp;P 500)
* QQQ had a **9.65%** increase (Nasdaq 100)

I'm hoping the next cycle will produce better results vs the ETFs.

The purpose of this post is to share my experiences with the different platforms and to help myself find the best platform for me (if any).

This performance is from 5/22 to 7/31

I'm really only following a few rules so I could keep my tracking accurate:

* No deposits during the cycle
* No withdrawals during the cycle
* No manual rebalancing
* After the cycle, swap out at least the worst-performing platform.

1 . Titan: **+7.03%**

1. Actively managed stock portfolio
2. Invests in about 20(?) hand-picked stocks
3. Fees
   1. $5 per month under 10k
   2. 1% over 10k
   3. Can be reduced...
4. 4 Investment Options
   1. Flagship (Large)
   2. Opportunities (Small / Under the radar)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   3. Offshore (International)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   4. Crypto (new)
5. The app is minimal and simple, like their investment choices.

* I think Titan is the newest of all the list of platforms here and it has performed above expectations. There aren't many options, but I kinda like that, but only because they've been performing well.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Trying out the crypto management

2 . SoFi Automated Investing: **+4.19%**

1. Robo Advisor
2. 5 Simple Investment Options ranging from Conservative (100% bonds) to Aggressive (100% Stocks)
3. No Fees
4. Part of what they invest in is their own ETFs, but I believe they waive the fees? Don't quote me on that.
5. The app is awesome.
   1. It's amazing to see all your financial stuff in one place.

* I've been very happy with the SoFi platform as a whole. The automated investing has performed a bit better than expected and it's easy to use.
* In the last 10 weeks, I've started using SoFi for almost everything.
   * Money - Switched to use as my main bank (no stupid fees like other banks... looking at you BofA)
   * Credit Card - 2% back on everything
   * Invest - Opened 3 investment accounts
      * Active - You pick the stocks (Kinda like Robinhood)
      * Automated - Robo-advisor
      * Crypto
   * Relay Connections
      * Budgeting / Tracking sorta like Mint
      * You can connect different accounts and track your spending (Including other investment accounts)
   * Credit Score monitoring - Every week it updates

3/4 . M1 - Social Responsibility and Ultra Aggressive Pies: SR: **+4.07%,** UA: **+3.01%**

1. Active investing
2. You get to create things called ""Pies"" which allows you to allocate percentages for each ""Slice"" of the pie and you can easily rebalance to match your initial allocations.
   1. Slices can be other Pies, ETFs, or Stocks (afaik)
3. There are pre-built pies called ""Expert Pies"" which is what I'm using
   1. They range from General Investing to Hedge Fund mimicking to Dividends
4. No Fees
5. The app is easy enough to understand and is getting better.
   1. Managing multiple pies seemed a little bit of a hassle the first time I tried to do it.
   2. Also, understanding pie creation could use a class or video. You can have Pies within Pies within Pies.

* Pretty interesting concept compared to the others. Seems possible to match the stocks and allocations of what other advisors are doing and you get that all for no fees.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Rebalancing my Pie
   * Adding an ARK Expert Pie slice... yolo?

5 . Wealthfront: **+1.5%**

1. Robo advisor
2. Tax Loss Harvesting
   1. If your investment dips, it sells some of your ETFs and buys similar ones to show a loss on your taxes.
   2. Seems good for high earners, but not as useful for lower tax bracket incomes.
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount... can be increased
4. The app is simple and allocations are easy to change.

* The main benefit of Wealthfront is the TLH.
* It allows you to modify the allocations in which you're investing and what percentage goes into each.
   * These can be stocks, bonds, socially responsible, commodities, and a good bit more... Even crypto (which are invested in investment trusts rather than straight crypto)
* TBH, kinda seems like just an M1 Pie with more limited options.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Changing about 50% of the default allocations, putting some into crypto (limits you to 10%), and some other sectors I'm interested in.

6 . Betterment: **+1.31%**

1. Robo advisor
2. 5 ""investment"" strategies. The main ones are Core (their go-to) and SRI (Socially Responsible)
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount. Resets every year... can be increased
4. The app is simple but figuring out how to just change my investment strategy took like 5 minutes of searching. They should make that easier.

* It does okay. Simple platform, simple choices. I can't change the specific allocations, but it also seems like I could recreate this in M1.
   * I recently switched to the SRI and there's a total of 5 ETFs it's holding.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Switched to SRI instead of the Core to see if it performs any better and if it's worth keeping around.
   * If it continues to perform near the bottom, I'm closing it out.

7 . SigFig: **-.34%**

1. Robo advisor
2. You take a questionnaire to determine your risk level which determines your percentage of Stocks vs Bonds
3. Opens your account through TD Ameritrade
4. .25% advisor fee over $10k
5. Has Tax Loss Harvesting but it never happened for me
6. The app is simple but not very good
   1. My favorite screen is where it shows just how much it's underperforming compared to the S&amp;P 500. smh

* First off, I chose this because it's one of the oldest robo-advisors out there and has a generally good track record.
* Second... it took **3 WEEKS** for my deposit to go through so it can start investing. Every other platform took about **3** ***days***.
* Third, **-.34%???**
* So, it should be obvious by now that this one is getting dropped. Didn't have a good experience with it at all. And I expected very little to begin with.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Withdrawing my money and closing my account... Hopefully doesn't take another 3 weeks to withdraw.
   * Trying out another investment platform. Decided on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. A little concerned with the amount they keep in cash reserves. We'll see how it performs.

What's your experience with investment platforms?

What are your favorites?

I'll try to be back again in a few months with another update.

39,investing,Questions about calculating the volatility of a stock,"I know there are many different ways to calculate volatility, dependent on how you're measuring it. One of the ways on [this site](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-calculate-stock-volatility/), however, seems to be a bit lacking. They calculate the interday changes as percentages and then take the standard deviation of these returns, but this means that a stock which goes up 10% every day will be less volatile than a stock that goes up 1% and down 1% every two days?

76,investing,Why is a low market capitalisation so bad?,"The title is self-explanatory but I'll try to give it a bit of a context.

In trying to understand cost of equity, I realised that it all comes down to the fear of a low market capitalization.

From the point of view of a company, a low market cap means that a hostile takeover becomes a risk for management but beside that, what else would that mean? Less exposure to indexes that leads to less exposure to investment funds, so less free marketing? Why would less volatility due to a less traded stock be a bad thing?

94,investing,Are dividends just for psychological comfort?," 

For instance, companies that pay decent dividends &gt;2.5% are older more mature slower growing companies. Why would someone take buy shares in an old business whose stock price will barely move just because they get 3 4 or 5% return?

In another situation, you could invest in growth stock-- which are more volatile, however we can take advantage of their dip to buy more shares-- and get more capital appreciation.

In example one lets say you buy an old company like $KO which has gone up 18% in the last year + 3% dividend lets say you get a 21% return this year (of course and exceptional year for the market and will likely not continue giving 21% due to lack of growth.

If you bought $QQQ, you would have a much higher return 34.5% in the past year (especially over the past five years blows any dividend etf out the water) but you would have missed that because it only offers .5% dividend.

It is not hard to imagine that growth stocks will continue to outperform value because of their technological innovative advantage. So are dividends just for pure psychological motivation to keep the investor investing? Because he can yield that and then some in capital appreciation. As stated qqq up 34% this year, thats like getting a 34% dividend yield! I can sell as much as I want and spend it anything-- just like a dividend, so whats with all the bruhaha regarding divies?",1629019366

We, at weInvest, predict we will soon be paid to trade. here's an explanation behind our thesis 

in 1999, around 20% of household owned stocks. that was 15% in 1995. this number inflated due to cheap trading and UIs from the likes of etrade and others. 

prior to 1975 commission for stock trading was expensive. full-service firms competed for your business. by the mid 90s discount brokers, following deregulation, were offering trades for 40-60 dollars. this was half of what it cost before deregulation. 

in the late 90s, etrade took off with the discount brokerage model, and charged roughly $20 per trade. by 2001 they brought their commission down to $13. at that time 2/3 of their revenue came from trading commissions and the rest came from interest on cash balances. comissions continued to fall. by 2017 the average fee per trade was less than $10. a couple years later, trading was free. couple more years later, robinhood would ipo for over 30b. etrade on the other hand, was acquired by MS for  13b. etoro with a 10b spac. 

With the broker/dealers worth tens of billions, and daily revenue amounting to many millions; the free markets, the sharing economy, and the creator economy, will drive these prices down below zero. you will be paid to trade. the future is a decentralized organization, owned by the community. a DAO that allows token holders to vote on governance. 

this is the vision for weinvest. we have built a functional protocol and APIs. we have established go-to-market partnerships to begin facillitating trading cryptocurrencies for low fees, less than what you pay at coinbase. trade stocks commission free.

In this excel spreadsheet net borrowings are calculated by: 

Short/Current Long Term Debt + Long Term Debt - Cash &amp; Equivalents &amp; Short Term Investments

Now, basic math tells us that if either Short/Current Long Term Debt or Long Term Debt are above 0, the net borrowings will be a negative number, assuming the Cash &amp; Equivalents &amp; Short Term Investments are above 0 aswell. 

My current example is MSFT. They have \~130B Cash on hand and \~82B in Debt. If they were to clear their debt right now they would have quite a bit of cash left. With this in mind, how can Net Borrowings be \~-48B?

36,investing,Asset allocation strategies: Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio by age 60?," What is the best way of achieving your desired asset allocation by the age of your retirement?

In this example I’m going to ASSUME you want 60% equity and 40% bonds by the age of 60. The basic strategy I recommend could be used for any other asset ratio that has to be achieved by some age.

# Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio at 60 year old?

### OPTION 1: Buying/selling to rebalance towards “age minus 20 in bonds” ratio

This strategy involves selling/buying yearly to rebalance to “*Age minus 20 in bonds.*”, and for the upcoming year buy equity/bonds in that ratio.

**Age minus 20 in bonds:**

* 20-year-olds should have 0% bonds
* 30-year-olds should have 10% bonds
* 40-year-olds should have 20% bonds
* 60-year olds should have 40%.bonds

So you end up with 60% equity and 40% bonds at 60-year-old.

### OPTION 2: Only buy 100% equity and later only buy 100% bonds

With this strategy you start by ONLY buying 100% equity, and then based on your expected earnings and the expected return for equity/bonds, you pick an age where you start buying 100% bonds, in the hopes of achieving a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60!

I know that it’s a lot harder to hit a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60 using this strategy, but isn’t it superior in terms of return if you manage to do it? (because equity has higher expected returns and you hold it for a longer time with this strategy)

Also, this strategy has lower transaction fee’s, because you don’t ever sell to rebalance.

# My questions:

* Which of these 2 options for asset allocation to achieve a 60/40 equity/bond allocation by age 60 do you find optimal?
* Do you think some other strategy is better?
* What should I search for when researching this problem? Can you recommend any good papers talking about this?",1628971539

Could it be that it is just the way our brains are wired? Even more interestingly - could we profit by going against the way our brains are wired?

The Monty Hall problem is the one with the three doors. One has a flash car behind it and the other two a goat. Pick the door with the flash car and you win it. After selecting the door the host opens one of the two other doors with a goat behind and asks you if you want to change. Most people select the wrong answer. Almost everyone, including highly intelligent people, have great difficulty understanding why they chose not to switch doors, even though it would have given them a higher chance of winning. Even after the mistake is explained, it is far from being intuitive. There are numerous YouTube videos about this.

The problem  is interesting in itself, but even more so, the fact that some problem solutions are simply counter-intuitive.

Could it be that stock picking is one of these? I cannot present any evidence one way or the other, but what if it is?

""In Most Markets, Lower Risk Means Higher Reward"" by dawangy on LessWrong 

&gt;In my view, the most comprehensive empirical study of a similar result was in Frazzini and Pedersen. In this paper the authors examined the low beta phenomenon by constructing hypothetical portfolios that are long low beta stocks and short high beta stocks in market-neutral ratios. Using this approach, the authors determined that low beta was associated with excess returns in 19 out of 20 countries' stocks, and was also true in many alternative markets such as those for corporate bonds, treasuries, foreign exchange, and commodities. The in-sample effect was strongest in the Canadian stock market, and the Austrian stock market was the only studied market for which the effect was (very slightly) negative. The out of sample construction based on the methodology created in sample was also positive in all nations studied except Sweden. Note that this is slightly different from my headline, as it suggests that the ""risk-adjusted"" returns of low beta stocks is higher than those of high beta stocks. Not necessarily that the returns of low beta stocks are higher in general.

&gt;The hypothesis of Frazzini and Pedersen is that some investors are leverage constrained, meaning that they are less capable of borrowing funds in order to increase exposure to equity. This leads those less capable of leverage to seek the higher expected returns dictated by their preferences through exposure to riskier stocks, which reduces the risk adjusted expected returns of riskier stocks because investors will purchase them at discounted expected returns to achieve artificial market leverage.",1628891507

66,investing,CANSLIM/Minervini methods - thoughts/experiences?,"I have spent a fair amount of time in the last couple of months coming up to speed on the CANSLIM and Minervini methods (read the books, subscribed to their tools, traded the methods for three months now). I am wondering if anyone else is following these methods and would care to share experiences/lessons. 

Here's what I think at this point: 

William O'Neil's book (How to Make Money in Stocks) was very valuable and worth the time to the read it. The parts on the use of fundamental analysis to identify high growth stocks is very useful even though similar material can be found elsewhere (Peter Lynch). What I found truly insightful were the parts on the stock price behaviour near the top of the stock's rally (breaking support, climax tops, weak action) and the inclusion of 100 graphs of successful companies from the past. I spent quite some time analyzing those. What I also found nice is that he covers all components of the investment strategy (what to buy, when to buy, how much to buy, when to enter, when to exit) and not just parts of it. The chapter on market trend identification was also very useful especially the discussion of bottoming out and how to get in again. I really liked the book.  

I ended up thinking CANSLIM may be a good method to run a part of my portfolio focused on hypergrowth companies. The methods requires a fair amount of work (especially in the early part as you are learning it, I guess). The MarketSmith tool was very good, I found myself using it a lot. I was not quite convinced by his arguments to enter after price consolidation only (on breakouts from patterns). I understand the rationale (avoid getting stopped out on natural volatility pullbacks) but you can achieve it by other means - like entering in partial amounts and building the position up by pyramiding up without sitting and watching your stock to up 100% and waiting for the eventual 20% pullback and recovery. But I do follow it, just to be consistent, at least until I get better at the method. 

Minervini's books were equally useful and worth the time to go through them. I especially liked the Stage 2 concept (don't enter overexteded stocks) and the concept of risk budget. Again, between his first and second book, he discusses the complete strategy and not just bit and pieces of it. Good books as well. 

I found some parts of the books omitting important information: for instance, the 100 model stock charts only show the part where the stock runs up and not the part where it crashes afterwards. Or the fact that the model charts mention the stock went up 400%+ but do not mention that using this method, you would capture two times 20% of it, at best. But I guess they have a product to sell so you need to use your own judgement to analyze the information. 

Once I was through the three books, I started trading the method (in May). I am at a point where I am looking for people familiar with the method to discuss. Anyone care to share experiences?",1628873875
73,investing,Dynasty Trusts for Future Generations,"Would it be possible to set up a staged dynasty trust where you can leave money to your children, your grandchildren and future generations down the line where the money is to be split equally amongst living members that are adults? 

I was thinking about it today. In today's money your kids and grandkids can benefit from the majority of your assets, but if legal, you could also benefit future generations with smaller amounts of money with longer compounding time-frame. 

For example say you left 500k to your kids total but also split $1k for future generations and specified the money is to be held in say a total market fund for the duration until disbursement.

If you did that for the following 5 generations (assuming a generation is roughly 30 years) by the time the 5th generation received their initial $1,000 dollar investment, 1800 months would have passed. 

If that initial $1,000 averaged 6.5% over the 150 year periods between generations it would be over $17,000,000 which could be divided equally amongst all adults of that generation.

Cannabis - Once the US makes it legal on federal level the market will explode

Lab Meat - For environmental, ethical and efficiency reasons future meat will be produced in a lab

36,investing,LandOrc Uses NFT and DeFi Technology to Bridge the Global Real Estate Funding gap,"""The rising growth in Decentralised Finance provides an alternative to the fund strapped Real Estate industry leveraging the power of digitalization""

DUBAI, UAE, Aug. 13, 2021 /PR Newswire/ -- LandOrc, headquartered in UAE, is a new Tech solutions provider that facilitates lending for real estate industry by providing access to Decentralised Financing (DeFI) and utilising land titles in non-fungible token (NFT) form as a collateral, with all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain for greater trust, transparency and speed.

The value of the world's real estate market reached US$280.6 trillion, the highest figure ever recorded by Savills'. With an annual increase of 6.2%, residential real estate accounted for the largest share (US$ 220.6 trillion) of the market. Commercial real estate (US$ 33.3 trillion) and agricultural and forestry real estate (US$ 27.1 trillion) made up the rest.

In 2017, the average global base lending rate was 11.53%, but it has since increased almost across the board in 2019 (11.57%). According to a 2020 KPMG report.

**Digitalizing the real-estate market with NFTs + DeFI**

Digitalization in the real estate market has been emerging. However, processes are often a time and labour-consuming affair and have often been seen as a stagnant investment for large corporations, especially those with assets in different countries.

""Property Developers need loans for development and this funding gap needed to be closed. In came the private lending sector to support, but alas, the Covid-19 pandemic led to a decline in both capacity and appetite to lend as companies shifted their focus on their existing businesses and bottom lines.""

""Furthermore, there is a dearth of transparency in processes causing volatility in property prices and coupled with slow transactions, the real estate market is in desperate need of a digital transformation. Complicating these are the snail-paced speed with which transactions occur,"" said Damo, Chief Executive Officer of LandOrc.io.

The NFTs are built on blockchain, a distributed ledger technology currently being widely adopted for various applications. NFTs are essentially digital tokens that carry data and are stored in the immutable blockchain ledger.

NFTs optimize real estate processes by implementing it in infrastructural, architectural, or physical assets such as buildings and title or ownership deeds. 

As NFTs can be digitally represented, tracing and tracking ownership and authenticity of the digitally represented asset is simplified to a fraction of the time taken in traditional processes.

Land NFT (LNFT) represents the land title on the blockchain allowing for tracking changes in ownership as it moves from the wallet, including placing it as collateral for lending.

Associated information like valuation, site location, and visuals, as well as vicinity analysis are brought on-chain via oracles and stored in the associated IPFS (InterPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol) for easy and secured access.

This allows for hybridized digital-physical land titles that makes authentication and tracking and tracing of ownership of properties a breeze.

**LandOrc's NFT + DEFI ecosystem features**  


* simplified complex real estate transaction processes
* shortened traditional real estate transaction processes from 4 months to 21 days
* ease of managing collateral due to traceability of ownership
* real estate lending options that are lower than locally accessible rates

""The time has come for property players to look into NFTs as a realistic and practical solution to circumvent the pain points that have been plaguing the industry for decades,"" said Damodharan Vijayaragavan, Chief Executive Officer of LandOrc.io.

Decentralised Financing (DeFi), the process of using blockchain based financing, has grown to USD 87 billion in May 2021 based on Defi Pulse Data. Thus, providing a new source for bridging the real estate funding gap.

LandOrc enables DeFi participants to utilise LandOrc Tokens (LORC) as alternative financing for staking on property development projects. Members of the LandOrc ecosystem are involved in key decisions of the platform including the choice of projects for lending. The Land Governance Token (LGOV) can then be utilised to vote for the choices made in a transparent manner on the blockchain.

Squareat is an innovative startup created to revolutionize the “ready to eat” food industry

How?

The answer is modular squared food.

Squareat unique production chain allows to transform raw foods in standardized 50-gram squares that are healthy, natural long lasting, tasty and easy to store and deliver.

""We have experienced first-hand the inefficiencies of the traditional meal plan services and have seen a clear possibility of disruption in bringing a complete transformation to a sector that is growing tremendously fast, introducing a brand new concept. Thanks to the Squared shape we are able to run a mass production while using gourmet techniques. Thermal shocking conservation, low temperature cooking and vacuum sealing packing allow us to produce a superior quality food and sell it at an affordable price.

Paolo Cadegiani, Founder and CEO of the company, explains.”

Squareat team is a combination of young and passionate entrepreneurs, high rated chefs, web developers and designers with more than 10 years of experience in the industry.

For the first phase the business is focused on a meal plan delivery service but their goal is to expand the distribution throught  many different channels taking advantages of the versatile product’s nature and its unlimited applications.

More investments will certainly accelerate this process bringing the company quickly to the next level. 

The campaign launched on Wefunder, the largest crowdfunding portal in the United States, aims to raise the funds allocating the investments both on  developing  a complete automatized production chain and the marketing campaign . This will result in a big improvement of the production while cutting costs significantly.

I’ve seen 14.8% returns over this period, but since the fund is essentially a mix of the 1 fund and 2 fund portfolio recommendations (pairing a target date fund with a total market index fund), should I expand into a third fund (perhaps an international stock market index fund or a US bond index fund) or just leave my portfolio as is? Thanks for all the advice, I enjoy learning from this sub!",1628778829
40,investing,Free random share on Freetrade!,"I have started using Freetrade for my investments in stocks, after my friend suggested it. I didn't expect much but when I signed up both of us got one free share, now this share is random anything from £3 to £300 I believe, but most likely you'll get something in the £10 area the highest I have reviewed received is £9.

All you have to do is sign up and deposit any money, I started with £1 and withdraw it the same day then in the next 7 days your free share will unvail and you can choose to keep it or just sell it there and then. I just sold the few I've got and invest in my usual stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.**

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *–  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication —  not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology:

*TheStreet  Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares.

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered  the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.

**6. Piotroski F-Score**

The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.

**7. Moody’s Daily Credit Risk**

Moody’s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.

**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:

*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*

*A  low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

52,investing,Easy 7.4% returns by loaning out stablecoins ... thoughts? How to assess risk?,"The reputable crypto exchange Gemini has a program (Gemini Earn: [https://www.gemini.com/earn](https://www.gemini.com/earn) ) wherein users can loan out their crypto assets and earn interest for participating. Best I can understand, Gemini loans your assets through (to) a company called Genesis ([https://genesistrading.com/lending/](https://genesistrading.com/lending/)), who loans the crypto to exchanges who need it for liquidity or market making....or something.

On upside, this is a way to make an extra \~3%/yr on bitcoin or ethereum. Interestingly, they offer 7.4%/yr for participating with a few stablecoins, meaning the value of the coins does not change and you make a ""guaranteed"" 7.4%/yr.

The fine print states the the loan is not secured; borrowers post no collateral. So, if I participate, I understand that the coins I loan out may never be returned. This brings several questions to mind and I'd love to hear some thoughts:

1) Is there any way to assess the level of risk here? How can we possibly determine if this is a good investment? With bonds, there is some calculable measure of risk via credit ratings, but this program seems 100% opaque beyond vague promises that borrowers are heavily vetted.

2) Given that these loans are all aggregated and packaged on the Gemini side, to the point where we can withdraw our ""loaned"" assets at any time, How would Gemini distribute the losses if a borrower defaults on repayment?

Management reported revenues hurt by low tomato prices and bad growing results, plus they’re changing the company structure of the SPAC thats less than a year old. Seems like they should have known the ideal structure from the get-go. In 5 years they’re talking about ebita around 115 to 130 million, and are currently valued at ~850 million with ~295 million in cash that should be spent up quickly as they grow. 

That all being said, I’m always interested in taking a look at a stock when it falls this quickly because companies don’t change value that fast overnight (normally).

I would like to find out what mental tricks you use to get around the loss aversion bias.

I have been listening to a talk by Daniel Kahneman.

He refers to the loss aversion bias. We feel the pain of loss more than the pleasure of gains. He refers to a psychological experiment of tossing a coin. If it landed heads, you would lose 1k. How much would you have to win to make it worth while. It seems that the answer is approx 2-to-1.

He advises that we should take a broader portfolio view.

I was wondering what mental tricks you use. Because I am sure that it must affect me - even if I'm not aware of it.

This post is not mine, I'm re-sharing from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) because I see a lot of P&amp;D's on reddit, and don't want anyone to lost money!

&amp;#x200B;

**Original post:**

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years, with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's due diligence process is different. Find what works for you!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.

* **Price upside/ targets &amp; Analysts rating consensus**. I am curious about what the analysts covering a stock think it's worth. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets.

2. *ChartMill*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings)  


* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**. I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:** I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign

&amp;#x200B;

* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?

&amp;#x200B;

* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.

* How many **ETFs** that hold this stock? Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?

1. ETFDB: [https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/](https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Social sentiment**. I check what people are saying on twitter and google search trends.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it. How large/small are the bid/ask spreads?

One of Benjamin Graham’s investment criteria instructs conservative investors to avoid trading stocks trading above 1.5x their book value. If one would have followed this advice, in the last decade they would hold nothing but a few insurance and bank stocks.

Just before Graham died in 1976 he was asked if detailed fundamental analysis of stocks (a technique he became famous for) was still a favorable investment strategy, his exact words were -

&amp;#x200B;

We've all read about paintings being bought and sold for tens of millions of dollars and wondered how could something that a 5-year-old could make be worth so much! We've gawked at the magnitude of money changing hands in the highbrow world of fine art and wanted to be part of the game. 

Just like startups, where only a fraction goes on to become unicorns, a minuscule percentage of artists command million-dollar price tags. They're the Picassos, Basquaits, Warhols, and Monets of the world.

Art prices, like startup valuation, can seem mystical. They're driven by popular trends, condition, rarity, popularity in pop culture, quantitative factors like auction history and provenance (who's owned it before you). Here's a look at how art markets work and how retail investors can profit from it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

* Art is a $1.7 trillion market.
* Institutional exposure to art is just 1% of their portfolio, compared to 38% in listed equities (large opportunity for growth).

**Pros of art investing**

1. **Art is uncorrelated to equity markets.** The correlation factor stands at 0.34.
2. **Art is resilient in market downturns.** Buyers of artwork tend to be ultra HNIs who normally have disposable incomes even during market downturns. During the 2008 crisis where equity markets dropped around 50%, art markets dropped around 20%.
3. **Art performs well in high inflation regimes.**

**Cons of art investing**

1. Quantitative data &amp; research are scarce and not available publicly.
2. ~~Illiquid~~. Art used to be illiquid but with the advent of fractional investment platforms, can be bought and sold just like stocks. Trading volumes however remain low.
3. Art assets do not generate cash flow

&amp;#x200B;

**How can a retail investor invest in art?**

1. **Use fractional investment platforms** like Masterworks, Otis, Maecenas, et al. These allow you to start investing with a few hundred dollars and gives you access to works by artists who have defined culture - Andy Warhol, Claude Monet, Basquiat, Kusama, and more.
2. **Join an art syndicate with friends and associates.** Most large art galleries run syndicates (special purpose entities in the form of partnerships) for their clientele to invest in a specific artwork.
3. **Invest in an art fund** like InArt, Atremundi, and Anthea. Investments starts from around $100,000.

77,investing,Any good books on the market/investing/financial system/economics you recommend?,"Looking at getting into reading physical books again and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions? I am looking for books a little more in depth about the market/investing, something a little challenging and interesting. Something that maybe dives into the financial system, economics or maybe behavioral finance as well. 

I’ve hears a lot of Michael Lewis books but haven’t read any yet. I was algo looking at the book “too big too fail”

Basically I am looking for something that is not basic investing or something for beginners. 

I would appreciate any advice or recommendations from anyone.

80,investing,Options Strategy Feedback,"Hi All,

I’ve been trading on the stock market for around four months now. Most of that has been trading shares, but I’ve gotten into options during the past month. I’ve developed a strategy that has largely served me well, but I would love some advice/cautions/feedback.

The whole idea is to play off of rebounds of early morning drops.

I’ve compiled a list of around 50 companies, mostly well established (TGT, MA, MSFT, etc.), that I watch closely each morning. I watch to see which ones drop during the first ~2 hours of the day, especially drops that seem to happen for no reason. I wait for it to rebound slightly (compared to the drop), then I load up on ITM calls, which hopefully pick me up some cash. The following morning, if the stock is up sometime within 30 min of market open, I try to close the options, rinse, and repeat.

For example, look at MasterCard $MA from today (6/10). I waited for the morning drop to start to slow, before putting in a bunch of calls. I ended up buying slightly too early, but still managed to score towards the end of the day.

I also watch for companies that do very well in earnings (ones that beat their estimations) but show sudden drops anyways. 

Lastly, before dumping my money, I look at the chart over the past month. If it has been steadily increasing, or if it seems to be at a trough despite it being an established company, I feel more reassured.

This strategy has done me well so far, but I acknowledge that by putting all of my cash into calls I am taking some serious risk, which is largely why I make them ITM calls.

Let me know any thoughts, or if y’all have any feedback or questions, as I’m still very new to this and hoping to improve!",1628653389
86,investing,Intellectual Property and Valuation: Thoughts from an FP&amp;A Analyst,"**PREFACE:  This is information not advice.  I have no stake in how you choose to implement this information.  It is simply to dive a little further into a topic that comes up now and then around which there seems to be some misunderstanding.  Also note, that this is a discussion of valuation from a fundamentals perspective.  That is, any mention of valuation herein solely concerns the key metrics and methods related to the current, fair value of expected, forecasted performance, not what will be the company's value based on the possible outcomes of developments yet to be.**

**SECOND PREFACE (with apologies to Tolkien):** Reposted because half of the original post was somehow missing.

Recently I was responding to a question about valuation and someone raised the notion that tech companies are massively undervalued because of their dependence on intellectual property.  On reflection I thought of a more complete answer to that question, the short version of which is:

Business valuation is a triangulation of many different metrics, and most if not all of what we are looking for is in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  And most of the ""gotchas"" to that are found in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The argument went something like this:  *Fundamental valuation doesn’t capture the contributions of intellectual property and therefore significantly undervalues tech companies \[in particular\].*

While it’s true that intellectual property itself at the conceptual stage is not to be found on the balance sheets, it’s *not* true that its monetary impact is absent or unknowable from the financial statements.

First, note that every industry has intellectual property. Tech is not unique or new in this regard.  But every company's intellectual property is moot if it cannot be transformed into products and/or services that make money.  That is, after all, the goal of every business.

The tech companies that supposedly have ""huge"" IP value don't actually make that claim in their financial statements, first because internally generated IP is not a recordable asset, and second because even acquired intangibles don't account for much.  Consider this: Out of $323 billion in total assets, AAPL, who patents hundreds of things they never even bring to market, has not listed a dime of intangible assets on their balance sheet since 2017. Facebook's gross intangibles are $5 billion out of $159 billion in assets... insignificant. Amazon's gross intangibles (MRQ) are $6.4 billion out of $321 billion in assets.

You can't value internally developed IP, particularly not at some arbitrary potential future sales you think might materialize.  It's valued only once there are costs associated with patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.  In the case of Amazon, even among the acquisitions recorded in the 2020 10-K, occurring since 2018, merely $28 million of that $5.2 billion is actually associated with the IP &amp; R&amp;D costs...most of that is likely R&amp;D.  And guess what method is used to amortize it?  That's right... Discounted Cash Flow method.

It's certainly important to understand the role IP plays in these companies but we don't just throw out Tangible Book Value in our longer analysis of companies (or the market).  That's simply a starting benchmark, like a decision point, where you decide whether it's worth your time to do further analysis or simply out of the bounds you have set for whatever your investment criteria may be.

So how are we to think about this?  Well, the reason we ultimately care about intellectual property is only because of a company's ability to convert it into operating cash flow.   So when we think about companies that have been around for more than a few minutes and change—Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (FAANG) all qualify—they must have some kind of paper trail, right?

At the end of the lifecycle of every intellectual property is a pot of money.  That's the goal.  Disney turns comic book characters into movies.  Apple turns [round rectangles](https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt) into iPhones.  Amazon turns one-click purchasing into endless shifts with no piss breaks... *These* are all measurable events recorded in the financial statements in some form or another.  

In this sense, when we go through a complete valuation exercise, soup-to-nuts, from Book Value to Fair Value, we *are* taking into account the company's history of turning IP into operating cash.

Tech companies like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, etc., all have products and services that went through this lifecycle.  You can see years of history of these companies converting intellectual property into cash flow.  You can see into the mouth of that funnel.  You see it in the relationship between SG&amp;A and Revenue, between PPE, Leases, headcount, inventory, and the like, and in the flow of money into and out of Retained Earnings.  The companies that are good at developing IP into profitable business segments grow, and thus grows the footprint of their Consolidated Financial Statements.

Every company exists to turn ideas into money.",1628649605

1. Is this advisable?
2. Should I split it between BTC and ETH or should I keep everything in either BTC or ETH  or should I consider some other altcoins too?
3. Is now a good time to enter the Crypto market?

In general, my video game stocks have been mediocre for the year in comparison to other stocks (EA = meh, Take Two pretty decent). 

I am most anticipating the new Switch that comes out in the fall with higher quality screens may bring back customers, the issue seems to be that they aren't releasing enough games and a game like Animal Crossing that came out during the pandemic just isn't coming around again, and most other games are not close to their sales.

A big reason I bought Nintendo was bc of it's prospects with Nintendo World (currently in Japan) as well, that are eventually coming to the US in 2023-2024, but now I'm hearing that apparently Universal or something owns/gets profits in the locations not even Nintendo? WT??

So what's going on here?

Disney turns Marvel IP into movies.  Apple turns designs into computers and iPhones.  Amazon turns ideas into warehouses with employees who work around the clock with no piss breaks, and so on... these are all recorded in financial statements.  These are all line items the company can and has put a number to.

If we think of a growth company, its economic moat is only as wide as the footprint of products and services that are the end purpose of the intellectual property lifecycle.  The end of that rainbow is a pot of money.  We understand that for a moat to get wider, the economic footprint should grow larger and we can see that footprint getting larger.  We can see SG&amp;A expense scale with Revenue.  We can see P/P/E, leases, etc., scale with heeadcount.   We can see money moving into and out of Retained Earnings, reflecting the Cash Flows from Operations that ideally grow with the breadth of the business's product mix, channel mix, moat, and so on.

So how does this then impact valuation overall?  Well, when we get to the issue of Fair Value, consider that the act of discounting future cash flows implicitly takes into account the company's historical track record of producing operating cash from cash generating assets and intellectual property pipeline.  So there is nothing in the comprehensive walk from Book Value to Fair Value that inherently undervalues tech companies.  Every company under the sun converts ideas to money.",1628632323

Now it is sent to the House of Representatives, after which it will wait for an agreement on Biden's desk. The size of the package is $1 trillion, but only $550 billion will be directed directly from the federal budget. 

Package contents: 

• $110 billion - roads, bridges and other immediate infrastructure - according to the White House, now in the United States about 20% of roads and 45 thousand bridges are in poor condition. 

• $73 billion in clean energy - new power grids, electrification of public transport and the installation of charging stations for electric cars. 

• $66 billion - trains - to upgrade passenger and freight railways, build new stations. 

• $65 billion - high-speed Internet - bringing the Internet to rural and poor areas and lowering prices at the expense of government grants to providers. 

• $55 billion - water infrastructure - replacement of pipes and provision of drinking water. 

• $39 billion - other support for public transport. 

• $21 billion - treatment of soil and groundwater at old mines and gas production sites.

After the adoption of this package, discussions will begin on a larger plan for $3.5 trillion. It should include $726 billion for schools, $332 billion for affordable housing and another $198 billion for clean energy.

Bottom line, I love investing but I understand I'm an amateur. If I found someone I believed in, I would happily dedicate a portion of my portfolio to copying their investments to a T and seeing how it holds up to what I'm doing.

I'm sure there would be a fee associated with this and I would be happy to pay a fee as long as it wasn't a scam. A lot of the crap I see on Youtube ads feel like a scam. Motley fool feels like a scam.

**Greater-than-Expected Profit Driven by Accelerating Organic Revenue Growth and Scaling Operating Leverage**

**Completion of AdColony and Fyber Transactions During the Quarter Empower Differentiated Full-Stack, End-to-End Platform Capabilities and Strategically Position the Company for Significantly Larger Addressable Market Opportunity**

AUSTIN, Texas, Aug. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Turbine, Inc. (Nasdaq: APPS) announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, 2021. All operating results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, refer only to the continuing operations of the Company, and all comparisons to prior periods have been adjusted to reflect only continuing operations. The Company completed the acquisitions of AdColony Holdings AS and Fyber N.V. on April 29 and May 25, 2021, respectively. Therefore, the actual reported results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, reflect only the partial contributions of those acquired businesses beginning on the dates the acquisitions closed. Specific references made to ""pro forma"" results in this release provide investors with quarterly results and comparisons as if all acquired businesses were owned for the entirety of the first quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. The Company believes that pro forma results, where applicable, can provide investors with more relevant year-over-year comparisons. The reconciliations between the pro forma and GAAP financial results for the relevant periods are provided in the tables following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.

**Recent Financial Highlights:**

* Fiscal first quarter of 2022 revenue totaled $212.6 million. On a pro forma basis, as if both Fyber and AdColony were owned for the full quarter, total consolidated pro forma revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $292.0 million, representing a 104% increase year-over-year as compared to the comparable pro forma figure for the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
* GAAP net income for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per share, as compared to GAAP net income of $9.9 million, or $0.11 per share for the fiscal first quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income1 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $33.4 million, or $0.34 per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $12.5 million, or $0.13 per share, in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
* Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $39.8 million, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.

""We are off to a fast start in fiscal 2022 with more than 100% year-over-year pro forma revenue growth and more than 150% year-over-year growth in both EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS,"" said Bill Stone, CEO. ""Not only did we continue to showcase the inherent operating leverage of our platform model with our strong bottom-line performance, but even more importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of full-stack, end-to-end platform capabilities that we believe strategically position the Company for continued prosperity well into the future. We are capitalizing on a unique opportunity to leverage our extensive on-device software presence and long-term partnerships with global carriers and OEMs to significantly expand our addressable app ecosystem market opportunity, and we are already witnessing a very positive initial reaction from advertisers all across the platform. We look forward to updating investors on the realized synergies for the Company and improved overall performance for app publishers and advertisers on the platform as fiscal 2022 progresses.""

81,investing,are there any studies on the acceleration of national debt vs the timeline of when that money owed on the bonds begins to show up in asset prices?,"In other words, when the treasury sells bonds, theyll have more money to spend on government stuff, and what they spend that money on will likely determine which assets go up. However, when they start repaying those bonds with interest, my intuition tells me that the bond repayment money will most likely end up in real estate or financial assets. So my question is, when does this repayment money end up make its presence known in asset prices? Is it gradual given that bonds themselves are inherently gradual, or do national debt accelerations like over this past year have some sort of immediate kick that reverberates over multiple years in some known or studied pattern?

 **Roscan Gold (RCGCF/ ROS.v)**

**Price: $0.25 US/ $0.33 CAD**

**Market Cap: $81M USD/ $106M CAD**  


**\*\*Price Target:  $3**

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** 

**Lets start with the coles notes for owning gold:**

&amp;#x200B;

Money printing is not new but the magnitude of recent printing among central banks around the world is unparalleled. If you are concerned by the fact that 40% of all US dollars in existence have been printed since 2020, precious metals are good hedge for the coming inflation. The US government has been printing massive amounts of new money. On January 6, 2020, the US Federal Reserve had around $4 trillion dollars. On January 4, 2021, the number increased to $6.7 trillion dollars. Money is usually a medium of change to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between buyers and sellers. However, since there is no productivity (good and services) to back up the trillions of dollars currently in circulation, printing more money doesn’t necessarily increase the economic output (productivity), it only increases the amount of money circulating in the economy. Too much money in circulation chasing the same amount of goods leads to inflation. We have already witnessed the price of many commodities (lumber, copper, oil, etc) increase in price but gold is yet to increase at the same rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Central banks continue to replenish and build their official gold reserves as part of policy. Speculators, institutional investors and end-users will also be marginal sources of demand for the commodity. The purchasing power of our dollars is clearly diminishing. Do not be fooled into following CPI as a measure of inflation- because that is not at all the case (i encourage everyone to dig deeper into this on your own time). We have clearly seen the cost of everyday items spike higher as input costs have all gone up. Not to mention a progressive political movement that is moving towards higher minimum wages across the country. Which will eventually aggravate inflation pressures. 

The daily price swings in the underlying commodity shouldnt scare anyone. Many typical gold investors have temporarily been lured to crypto-currencies promising similar protection. Im not here to bash cyrpto. Its too volatile and has too many unknowns for me at this time. The gold life cycle is tried and proven. As a non-interest bearing asset, investors are always looking at the Fed Rate. Now consider again the MASSIVE amount of money that was just printed, the amount of debt taken on by the Fed is huge! The dirty little secret that sophisticated investors understand but the Federal Reserve will NEVER openly state is that rate will stay lower for longer in order to pay back and manage this new debt. Why would the federal reserve increase rates and force themselves to pay more in an unsustainable cycle. Another alternative is for The Fed to keep printing more and more, which will only diminish the value of our dollars further and create more supply of dollars in circulation.  If you read the investment letters of all the top investment managers across the spectrum, this is the consistent theme. (Happy to share where to access this if anyone has interest)

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, you dont have to go all-in YOLO on gold but at least get some exposure to it. But how?...

&amp;#x200B;

**2)**

**How to get gold exposure?**

Owning a combination of physical gold and gold equities is ideal. Physical gold can be bought and sold almost anywhere in the world for the going market rate. Owning paper gold (aka futures contracts) is not ideal for retail investors like us and it's no secret that this market is often manipulated.

&amp;#x200B;

For the largest potential reward, you want to own gold exploration companies that are early in the gold cycle, not yet producing gold. There are a number of reason why these are ideal bets:

\-as they are in the early stages, there are many catalysts that will slowly remove risk form their story and increase the stock price (positive drill results confirming resource quality, declaration of a maiden resource, building/securing of infrastructure, completing mine feasibility/economic studies). The goal is to find an exploration company that is most likely to check all these boxes and become an actual built gold mine and/or acquired by a Major (aka one of the large global mining companies).

\-Late stage producers are more affected by swings in the commodity price. While exploration companies have a set path to follow as they develop to the later stages.

\-Good exploration companies are harder to find, often overlooked by the market. 

\-You dont want to own broad junior mining ETFs because for every dollar you invest, you may get exposure to a handful of good companies but most of your invested dollars will be spread among risky and often garbage companies that would mean unnecessary risk.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can find an exploration company that ticks all the boxes, you will be handsomely rewarded. What do we look for?

&amp;#x200B;

**Roscan Gold (RCGCF/ ROS.v)**

**Price: $0.25 US/ $0.33 CAD**

**Market Cap: $81M USD/ $106M CAD**

&amp;#x200B;

Roscan Gold is gold exploration company has its flagship asset located in Southwest Mali, among the most favorable mining destinations in the world, whose camp is surrouned by other Major publicly traded Gold Miners with multi-million oz reserves and existing infrastructure. Within a 40KM radius of Roscans property we have the following immediate neighbours: B2Golds Fekola Mine (7M oz+), Barrick Golds Louolo/Gounkoto Mine (13M oz+), Allied GOlds Sadiola Mine (7M oz+). Roscans current land package is over 3.1X larger than the closest neighbouring B2Gold Fekola Mine which is important to note because this makes Roscan an ideal acquisition target for all of them. The worlds Major Miners have under-invested into new explroation projects over the last 10 years, and thus there is a gap in expected supply of the commodity- making proven companies in good jurisdictions attractive.  B2Gold would have liked to be approved for their nearby Anaconda exploration permit to feed into Fekola milling operation but the Mali government has recently revoked their request for a permit. B2Gold has also lowered their grade cutoff and increased their resulting production expectations at Fekola. The point being that B2Gold will likely look to Roscan in the near future. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were already in the data room.

&amp;#x200B;

The mgmt. team of Roscan is also impressive and most likely to execute. Nana Sangmuah, CEO, has 20 years of international mining and investment banking experience. Has a strong network of contacts within Mali and NA capital markets. Sir Samuel Jonah, Chairman of board, is the former CEO of Ashanti Gold. Greg Isenor, founder of ROS, discovered the nearby Sirabaya deposit and sold it to IAMGOLD. Michael Gentile, director on board, is a former portfolio manager of one of the largest mining and resource funds in Canada, he is a sophisticated investor and continues to be involved in the industry. This is not a pump and dump but in fact a real company with an elite team ready to build this mine or sell at a juicy price tag.

&amp;#x200B;

The quality of drill results is among the highest. As a rule of thumb anything above 1g/t is excellent grade. Roscan has much higher grades and across wide length and significant depth. Dont be tricked by ""1 meter"" width and high grades. That is a common trick used by pumpers to make the appearance of high grade results, there is no trickery here. This is a real asset, the company expects to announce a maiden resource in Q4 of this year.  

(please look at pg 9: [https://roscan.ca/site/assets/files/3999/20210727\_ros\_corporate\_presentation\_final.pdf](https://roscan.ca/site/assets/files/3999/20210727_ros_corporate_presentation_final.pdf))

 

In conclusion, ROSCAN is in an ideal jurisdiction, has an elite management team, solid institutional shareholder base,  consistently high-grade drill results, a meaningful asset about to be announced in the coming quarter. Following the recent trading activity and filings, indicates there has been clear selling pressure since mid-june. The gold equities have also been under pressure as we are in the middle of summer vacation season, and no marginal buyers are accumulating the stock yet. This recent pressure provide a doubly-juicy opportunity to own a deeply discounted explorer at floor prices, while we approach the end of selling pressure. Once that is relieved it will be difficult to accumulate stock. My price target on this stock is $3, i expect it will be hit there once the resource is announced and more developments made, by 2022. By end of year, i think the stock gets to $1.50-$2 easily.

49,investing,Getting ahead in Hearing aid investing before law is enacted. Good idea?,"Sonova Holdings: SONVY or SONVF

Biden recently issued an executive order to speed up the roll out of OTC hearing aids. And hope to start implementing otc between March-July 2022. 

The hearing aid market doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of investment activity compared to other health industry markets. There is an undeniable growth in the market share since this past year. In 2017 Congress passed a law that allows for over-the-counter hearing aids to be sold in the US because hearing aids are not covered in the ACA or Medicare. 
Hearing aid corporations have been very much against this idea of OTC hearing aids because they feel that hearing loss is very complicated (and it is). Most hearing aid companies saying that they have no interest in developing an otc hearing aid. Similar to OTC glasses you can buy at the pharmacy. 

Sonova Holdings is a behemoth in the hearing health industry and this past May 2021 they recently purchased a smart tech headphone/earbud company called Sennheiser. This purchase is in preparation for the OTC hearing aid rollout next year. 
Some other notable companies they own are: 
Phonak (pediatric hearing aids)
Unitron (micro hearing aids) 
Advanced Bionics (cochlear implants)
AudioNova (Europe’s largest hearing aid retailer) 

The acquisition of Sennheiser will definitely raise the bar for sound quality targeted toward hard of hearing individuals. The biggest dilemma in hearing loss is identifying which frequencies need to be amplified and which ones don’t. 

Pro: OTC hearing aids will reduce the stigma with hearing technology and open the door to costly prescription hearing aids. OTC is only intended to mild to moderate hearing loss. Individuals with persistent hearing loss will eventually need prescription hearing aids. 25 [states](https://www.asha.org/advocacy/state/issues/ha_reimbursement/) have supplemented the ACA with hearing aid coverage mandates for children and 5 of those states also cover adults. Insurance coverage for hearing aids continue to expand. 

Con: otc hearing aids could potentially take a large portion of the market share. Larger tech markets like Apple might try their hand at OTC Hearing Aids. There’s still stigma with hearing loss. 

Disclaimer: I don’t work for any tech company. I have a 6 year old who wears cochlear implants (CI). He was born deaf and at 9months old had a surgical procedure that inserted electrodes in his cochlea to make him hear synthetically (he speaks and hears really well). The first thing a parent or CI patient is told to do is to choose 1 of 3 Cochlear implant brands to have for the next 30 years. So you get very familiar with all of the brands from all of the initial research.  I’ve been keeping my eye on the market for some time.

71,investing,Should I suspend my retirement investment contract or not?,"Hi all,

As I am from Europe I try to explain as good as possible. In my country you can invest a monthly amount, say 100 bucks, and an insurer invests this money on the stock market. On top you receive a premium from the government. Sounds too good to be true, right? It’s supposed to be a tool for citizens to build for retirement.

But: Fees are high (administration, sales, ..) and returns have been very low. I did the math and likely this deal will make me 1,5% a year until I retire in 27 years. Before taxes though!

That is a very low return and I think I can beat this over the next 20+ years by simply ETF investment. I have two options now:

A) suspend contract: no more payments from me go into this contract, however I still have to pay some fees. In the end the amount already in my pension fund will continued to be invested for a poor 1,5% and will likely reach 30k in 27 years.

B) Cancel contract: I will get all the money back, minus premiums I have received and minus taxes I need to pay on current capital gains.

-&gt;If I cancel I get 10k net today. So i loose 20k immediately.
-&gt;If I simply suspend contract it will be worth 30k in 27 years

Would you take the 10k now and take the chance to make more than 30k in 27 years? This means I would take chance/risk of either outperforming this deal in place or screw up and do worse.

Technically I just need to wait for another big correction and buy an ETF, that should triple my investment alone. On the other hand I don’t want to feeds an insurer with fees for poor returns.

93,investing,"HarmonyOS 2 Has Been Released for Two Months, The Number of Developers Exceeded 1.2 million, More than 300 Apps joined the Harmony Ecosystem","Detail

&amp;#x200B;

The Securities Times reporter recently learned that as of now, HarmonyOS 2 has more than 40 million Huawei devices upgraded to adapt to HarmonyOS 2, the number of HarmonyOS developers has exceeded 1.2 million, and more than 300 Apps have joined the HarmonyOS ecosystem. In addition, since the release of HarmonyOS 2, a total of 65 kinds of devices have started the official version upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, users generally report that Huawei HarmonyOS 2 is stable and smooth in operation, pure and safe, and has longer battery life. Of course, some users said that they are not accustomed to some details of HarmonyOS 2 and that some old mobile phones have heat and application incompatibility after the update.

&amp;#x200B;

Some communication experts said that if you are an Android user, you can easily transition to Harmony, because both the interface and operating habits are similar. This shows that Huawei's development of Harmony itself is not to set another benchmark on the interface but to focus on customer experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, there are still more listed companies cooperating with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

In mid-July, Chipsea Technologies also disclosed that it had cooperated with HarmonyOS, which caused the company's stock price to rise sharply.

&amp;#x200B;

On August 3, Fenda Technology stated on the investor interactive platform that the elf learning smart screen produced by the company and H will equip with the HarmonyOS.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, recently Zhang Yunyong, general manager of the product center of China Unicom Group, also publicly disclosed that China Unicom is actively engaged in ecological cooperation with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also understood that listed companies such as Yusys Technologies, Hoperun Software, Sumavision Technologies, and Hanbang Technology have all started cooperation with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the US lawmakers called on the Commerce Department to add Honor to the ""Entity List"".

&amp;#x200B;

According to the press, 14 members of the U.S. House of Representatives asked the U.S. Department of Commerce to include the Honor Company on the government's economic blacklist. According to sources, a member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Michael McCall, said in a letter that Honor has been spun off from Huawei, which was included in the US Entity List in May 2019. Companies included in the list are prohibited from purchasing parts or using American technology from American companies without the approval of the U.S. government.",1628489336

Been around for a long time without material success, changes in management, silence on the PR front for an embarrassing amount of time, etc. But when you read through the below, something must be going on behind the scenes if they just got a Department of Energy grant to pursue their Halloysite based battery technology... and we all know how insane the market is for new battery tech. Looking at their PPS compared to what a valuation could be for a winning battery technology is almost hard to comprehend. It's simply remarkable to read through some of the research that has been done showing how much Halloysite can improve battery performance. 

Here is some info on the grant specific use case. Applied Minerals was awarded a DOE grant to develop low cost/high performance anode material from its halloysite resource
 
You can read the general DOE announcement for yourself here. 
https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-awards-54-million-235-american-small-businesses-developing-novel-clean-energy-and
 
All of the companies that got awards can be found in the excel. Applied is noted in the second Phase 1 award release doc here  science.osti.gov/sbir/Awards 
 
Here is the description of the application the award was granted for:

""Domestic Halloysite-Derived Silicon as a Low-Cost High-Performance Anode Material for Li-Ion Batteries.  
 
To enable the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, the cost of lithium-ion battery electrode materials must be reduced. This proposal will enable commercial production of high-performance, low-cost battery electrode material through an innovative process derived from a unique domestic mineral resource found in Utah.""

Additionally here are some interesting research papers regarding the use of Halloysite in the advanced battery space. What is so remarkable is there are multiple Halloysite applications for the lithium battery space that are advancing beyond just the application the DOE is interested in

As I dig deeper, one more thing to note. The company seems to also be pursuing Halloysite applications beyond just the battery space such as flame retardants and molecular sieves just to name a few. My guess would be those applications could be a way to fund the battery development. They also have a massive Iron resources they seem to be mining and using as a cash engine.

So if we expect some kind of vaccine booster do you think that will skyrocket the stocks or crash the market? or is it priced in?

reasons for skyrocket:

it means that the vaccines still work for the most part and this is the way, instead of shutdowns and job losses and too much social distancing, the vaccine will be free and all we have to do is we export less, but still have enough production.

reasons for crash:

it means that they think the pandemic will go on longer than expected, and much of 3rd world countries still not close to vaccinated, they will have to delay some shipments to those countries. also it can make some people refuse to take the boosters.

reasons it will be priced in:

this is because i think it depends on how urgent they think it is. if they expand approval for 12 yr old and under first i think its just priced in because we know its going to be around that time anyway. also i think most people dont care so thats why it's priced in.",1628453959

The founders pioneered blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs Remicade and Humira. Primary Active ingredient for Dupuytren’s Contracture is same drug already approved for another indication-Rheumatoid Arthritis the single largest market in pharmaceuticals. The founders discovered the biology behind anti TNF and are world famous academics including a winner of The Lasker Prize. Because the research was done on this P2B/ P3 on diseased human Dupuytren’s tissue the move straight to FDA drug submission upon proof of concept. Other indications being targeted in future in order are Frozen shoulder, POST Operative Cognitive Decline, NonAlcoholic Steatohepatitis (Fatty Liver Disease) and Ulcerative Colitis brought on by smoking cessation. Another pathway being targeted is pain and inflammation using SCA’s— synthetic cannabinol diet analogues. A founder is the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC and discovered the human endocannabinoid system. Also known as godfather of cannabis. But it’s synthetic and pure now think about pairing pain relief for musculoskeletal pain with the anti TNF meds proven effective on rheumatoid arthritis and consider that market. Get the picture. Now the CEO has a history of allowing data on patented medication to be released in academic setting. Current patents are probably worth more than stock price. Oxford is also home to founder Sir Ralph Winner of Lasker prize. So do you think anyone at FDA is denying a NDA for a medication already wildly successful for new indications for which there are no treatments? I don't think so.

# Synthetic CBD Analogs (SCAs)

180 Life Sciences aims to develop SCAs that are safe, non-psychoactive and formulated to improve efficacy and bioavailability – a real alternative to unregulated cannabidiol (CBD). This program is led by Professor Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in cannabis, and the endocannabinoid system. Typical botanical derived CBD contains impurities such as THC (the psychoactive compound within cannabis) and other minor cannabinoids. By developing SCAs, 180 Life Sciences will create a pure compound (&gt;99.5%) which offers accurate consistency across batches. Combined with novel formulations through use of patented ProNanoLipospheres (PNL), 180LS will deliver a superior CBD analogue that offers improved efficacy and bioavailability. These conditions create greater likelihood for obtaining regulatory approval.

AZUL - Azul Airlines Brazil. Top ranked airline in the world by TripAdvisor. Balance sheet was so strong that they refused government aid during pandemic. Favorite to acquire LATAM airlines and become top South American carrier in near future.

BP - British Petroleum. Technical play with solid setup and 90% near term upside. Thank me in 5 weeks.

SIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.

UGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.

VVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.

GPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..

SPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.

MCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.

JWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company. They blew people away by posting a profit in the depths of the quarantine and have started seeing numbers as high as 65% of all business being sold online and on mobile. Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.

NCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.

UAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward. Pent up demand will take this sweet technical base higher in the short term.

Why is investing in real estate always so talked about and regarded as one of the best investments? People talk about making passive income when the property is rented out to others and all but this is what I consider. 

I live in Australia, so a property that would cost approximately $700,000 AUD would normally be placed for rent for about $900/fortnight. Why is real estate such a good investment considering it would take ages to make all that money back. 

(I might’ve gotten the figures wrong, everything is just an estimation but literally from everything i’ve seen it would take an extremely long amount of time for that money to be made back, even if loans were taken out to pay for the property originally, youd still have to make that money back to pay the bank)

For Treasury rates to start trending higher over the long-run, either GDP will have to grow faster than the national debt or we have to cut spending dramatically (neither are happening under Biden). Until this upward trend in Debt/GDP reverses, Treasury yields will continue to head lower.

46,investing,Tokyo Catalyst? 3 CBD Stocks Expanding Horizons to Sports Medicine," The Tokyo Olympics has been one of firsts, for both the right and the wrong reasons.  One novelty that has attracted international attention at this current Olympic Games has been the number of athletes admitting to using CBD as part of their training program.  Given the starkly divided stance of different countries on the use--medical or otherwise--of cannabis and cannabinoids, athletes use of CBD has generated no little controversy (think Sha’Carri Richardson’s suspension from the Games for testing positive for marijuana use; not CBD, but still indicative of how strict the rules still are).  

Officially,  in 2018 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from its list of substances that are prohibited in or out of competition.  That said, ONLY CBD was removed from the prohibited list; the psychoactive component of marijuana, THC, is still prohibited.

Thus for the first time in the history of the Olympics, cannabidiol (CBD) has been allowed for use by elite athletes. There’s a lot of solid science behind CBD laying out its medical properties in tandem with it becoming gradually more socially acceptable to use for health, lifestyle, or in this case, elite athletics.

Right off the bat there are a number of obvious benefits in applying CBD to the field of sports medicine and athletics, such as:

* CBD is calming and can help quell general anxiety. There's stress in sports participation, so reducing anxiety without physical side-effects is key for ensuring peak game-day performance.
* CBD can help athletes with sleep without the use of downers or heavy sleep drugs.  Especially in the context of the Olympic, where athletes travel from all over the world to compete, CBD can be used as an organic way to overcome jet-leg and make-up sleep debt prior to performance.
* CBD can also help athletes with pain management.  In search of improved sports recovery and safer pain relief, many people are seeking out CBD as an alternative to over-the-counter pain relievers (i.e NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium).  Although CBD cannot remedy severe pain, it can be useful in easing the delayed onset of muscle stiffness after sport or just the general aches and pains that come with being an athlete.

These three particular ways CBD can help athletes can also be beneficial to the general public, hence the enormous therapeutic and medical potential of this substance that is just beginning to be realized by industry.  

And now lets take a look at the current market:

Over recent years, the CBD market has exploded. The global cannabidiol market was valued at USD 2.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% from 2021 to 2028.  Due to its healing properties, the demand of cannabidiol (CBD) for health and wellness purposes is high, which is the major factor driving the market growth. By 2023, Europe’s CBD market is set to rise by 400 per cent, according to Brightfield Group, a leading consumer insights and market intelligence firm for the legal CBD and cannabis industries.

CBD-infused goods are being widely used in industries such as beauty, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and personal care (among others) and technology has a big role to play in developing the CBD market. 

One company pioneering the use of CBD for sports medicine is Innocan Pharma(CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF).  These guys are a pharmaceutical tech company that focuses on the development of CBD-delivery platforms and topical solutions for a wide range of health, cosmetic, and general weallness purposes. Their R&amp;G Relief &amp; Go CBD Spray is one product in particular that combines the known benefits of active ingredients such as Menthol and Camphor with CBD and Magnesium (more than 40% in the formula) to help the body relax and recover for sport-performing professionals.

Charlotte's Web (TSE:CWEB)(OTC:CWBHF) is another innovator in the field of CBD sports medicine.  They offer a wide range of products organized according to symptom (e.g. exercise induced inflammation, sleep issues, etc) that can be customized to respond to the athlete’s (elite or amateur alike) specific needs.  cbdMD (NYSE:YCBD) has assumed a similar course, with a wide range of CBD topicals and ingestibles already on the market.

To wrap it all up, Tokyo is giving a platform for advocates of CBD like none other before.  We all know how powerful endorsements from world-class athletes can be in terms of normalizing the novel.  As a dedicated cannabis investor and enthusiast, I’m pumped (from a financial and also personal angle) to see how leaders in pharma and medicine harness the full potential of CBD in years to come.

72,investing,"WeChat’s youth mode is illegal, says lawsuit, as China steps up attack on Tencent $TCEHY","Prosecutors in Beijing have initiated a civil lawsuit against a subsidiary of Tencent, saying the “youth mode” on the company’s popular social messaging app WeChat does not comply with laws protecting minors.

The lawsuit was initiated on Friday by Beijing’s Haidian district people’s procurator-ate against Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems, according to a filing posted on JCRB.com, a website run by China’s top prosecutor, Reuters reported.

The document did not say how WeChat’s “youth mode” broke Chinese law. It said it could support other agencies and organizations that intended to bring lawsuits against the Tencent unit and asked them to contact the prosecutor’s office within 30 days.

Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WeChat’s “youth mode”, when turned on, limits young users’ access to some games and functions, such as payments or finding nearby friends.

Chinese authorities have called for minors to be better protected from online dangers, a sentiment echoed by state media this week which criticised the video gaming industry as well as online platforms that help promote celebrity culture.

Tencent on Tuesday announced new curbs on minors’ access to its flagship video game, Honor of Kings, after its shares were battered by a state media article that described online games as “spiritual opium”.

Reuters reported in April that China was preparing a substantial fine for Tencent as part of its sweeping antitrust clampdown on the country’s internet giants. But it is likely to be less than the record $2.75 billion penalty imposed on Alibaba.

I just wanted to get peoples opinions on the topic from what they have gathered or their perspectives on the situation. I use EDU ( New Oriental Education ) because it is the largest tutoring company and the one I am following the most, but this applies to TAL and other firms as well. 

So here, is what I have researched so far. The first thing is I have read a lot of new stories say is that all tutoring companies will have to go no-profit. From everything I have read that is not an accurate description. Companies that continue to teach "" core curriculum "" after the legislation will have to go into non-profit and are not allowed foreign investors. The non-profit label will not have to apply to establishments teaching non-core curriculum. Core being Ethics, rule of law, culture, history, math science and foreign language. Non-core being sports, health, art, music, fine arts, information technology, computer programing and non-academic skills. Not to mention, Vocational education and tutoring for adults and college students. 

Moreover, in the reports that I have read the policies will be enacted through pilot cities Beijing, Shangai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Changzhi, Weihai and Nantong. All other provinces shall select at least one pilot city. From every report that I have read this will affect at least 75% of most business's. Some business like EDU in particular it will have less than a 60% or less effect. EDU is currently making a pivot in their curriculum I recently read as early as yesterday that they are going to be offering new classes that fall under non-core curriculum.

36,investing,5 Things Investors Should Know Before Investing In A Metaverse Company,"1) Metaverse Popularity Soars After Zuckerberg Remarks

During the recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) would transform from a social media company to a metaverse company.

Definition: Metaverse refers to the sum of all the experiences in the digital and virtual worlds. It’s a concept that has been around for nearly 30 years, but it has picked up steam in the past few years as tech companies imagine new ways for people to live, work and play in a computer-simulated environment.

Popularity Upswing: According to Google Trends, searches for the word ‘metaverse’ have more than doubled since last week’s Facebook earnings call.

Facebook’s Role: Zuckerberg identified two potential ways for Facebook to capitalize on its investments in the metaverse: virtual reality devices and advertisements for digital goods.

Back to Reality: Facebook’s bet on the metaverse could pay off for the company and for investors, but it could take years before it comes to fruition.

Final Thoughts: In addition to Facebook, there are also other companies - both public and private - that are developing metaverse technologies. Details about investment opportunities in the metaverse will be shared every day this week on Early Bird.

2) Metaverse Investing: Stocks &amp; ETFs

Metaverse, a term that means the sum of all experiences in the digital and virtual, worlds, has taken off in 2021 as a focus area for retail investors.

Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) is one company that has already announced plans to position the company more in the metaverse. But for investors looking for metaverse options outside of FAANG, there are several options.

Big Player: Video game software development company Unity Software Inc. (NYSE: U) has positioned itself as a force in the metaverse. Unity’s technology makes it easier for people to develop video games, but the company is not profitable yet.

Sleeper: Tech company Nvidia Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) is aiming to take the metaverse by storm. Nvidia released NVIDIA Omniverse in December, which is like a metaverse for engineers and creators. It’s an open, cloud-native platform that allows users to create workflows.

Big Content: Entertainment companies will play a role in the metaverse. Disney (NYSE: DIS) is reportedly aiming to create a theme park metaverse powered by AI and the internet of things.

Digital Currency: In the metaverse, users will be able to buy things with digital assets, such as cryptocurrency. This is good for crypto stocks such as Coinbase Global (Nasdaq: COIN).

Final Thoughts: If you prefer funds instead of individual stocks, there’s the new Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, which was just released last month.

3)  Metaverse Startups Try Equity Crowdfunding

RiseAngle, an immersive gaming company that is also working on non-fungible token (NFT) games, is launching an equity crowdfunding campaign on September 15. There’s also a ‘Friends Invest First’ round that is already underway on the platform Wefunder.

This company falls into the category of the metaverse, a term that means the sum of all experiences in the digital and virtual worlds. This includes virtual reality providers.

Here’s a list of past and present equity crowdfunding campaigns in this space:

Business: Tocca, a company focused on business virtual events, launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on Wefunder in July.
Gaming: AEXLAB, a virtual reality technology studio, launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on StartEngine in July.

Shopping: Performlive, a commerce platform that includes augmented reality shopping, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Republic in July.

Let's Rewind: MyndVR, a health care virtual reality company, completed a $166,000 equity crowdfunding round in April.
Final Thoughts: As more metaverse startups launch, there will likely be more equity crowdfunding campaigns in this industry.

4) NFT Stocks For Retail Investors

As more public and private companies chase virtual reality, there’s also a clear link between the metaverse, which is a technical term meaning the sum of experiences in the digital and virtual worlds, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Definition: An NFT is effectively a unique digital asset that represents real-world assets, including collectibles, art, music and videos.
Bubble or Opportunity: More people have invested in NFTs in 2021. Some may call it a bubble, but the technology could introduce more people to the concept of the metaverse.

Data: The global metaverse market is expected to increase from $46 billion to $280 billion by 2025, according to Strategy Analytics.

Stocks To Invest In: If you really believe in NFTs, here are some stocks that are dipping their toes into NFTs: DraftKings (Nasdaq: DKNG), Dolphin Entertainment (Nasdaq: DLPN), Mattel (Nasdaq: MAT).

5) Metaverse's Potential Depends On The Government

As the metaverse (a term referring to the sum of experiences in the virtual world) becomes a popular investing trend in 2021, the success of the metaverse depends largely on the actions - or inactions - of government.

Alliance: South Korea took a proactive approach to the metaverse by launching an alliance of companies and researchers aimed at creating a national platform to support augmented reality.

Laws: Let’s face it, the laws of our world are not likely to keep up with the metaverse, so governments around the world might attempt to create new laws to match it. This might impact the innovations we have seen in both the public and private markets regarding virtual reality.

The Alternative: If the government doesn’t nurture or regulate the metaverse, then large companies that invested in the metaverse, such as Facebook (Nasdaq: FB), will control it. Do you really want Facebook to control this new world?

Final Thoughts: Will governments support the metaverse, such as what South Korea did, or not?

Obviously speculation is part of the stock market so one would expect a price to earnings ratio of greater than 12.5 or 8% yearly returns, however, there seems to be too much speculation. I don't think companies are going to become    profitable enough to warrant such a high level of speculation. There is definitely a bubble in many tech stocks in my opinion Tesla being the most extreme example in my opinion has a p/e of 365 and a market cap of nearly 700 billion meaning that they are not only a massive company, but also most likely wildly over valued. The feds ability to do market intervention is declining by the day due to the use of qe and near 0 interest rates.

17,investing,When do you increase your position?,"This post ended up longer than expected. If you want the details, see further below. However, here is the final paragraph and question to serve as a TLDR.

&gt; **TLDR;**

&gt; Therefore, the basic question I started this post to ask is, when is the time to consider increasing your position in a company, when the initial investment isn't behaving in the way you expected? How do you determine when to increase your position when a stock is on an upturn? Or do you never buy more shares until there is a pause or downturn in the price?

I approach this question believing each investment opportunity is its own unique animal. There's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Obviously, initiating and adding to a position in $VTI is going to have a different rationale than $MSFT or $HOOD.

For my investment philosophy, the majority of my capital is invested in the broad market (low cost ETFs or mutual funds) for the long term. I add to these regularly without any real regard to the current price. Just buy and wait. So, I have experience with this sort of long-term investment strategy and use it for the bulk of my portfolio.

On the other hand, I also maintain a small, but not trivial, amount of money for ultra-short-term trading, in which holding a position may last for a few hours up to a few weeks. These are usually Investments in long call options for when I see the potential for large growth within a short period of time. Although my record on the trades have yet to be proven in the long-run, so far they've ranged from catastrophic to middling. I'm hoping to research and learn and develop better strategies over time.

The strategy that I haven't tried yet, but that I'm finding myself needing a crash course in, is what I'd refer to as middle-term investing/trading. I recently found a company in a sector that I've been wanting to invest. It is doing work in an area I believe has much potential for looking-term development and grow. The corporate leadership has qualities that I admire and feel are socially responsible and progressive. The company recently had an IPO.

I initiated a modest position (3% of my overall portfolio value) in the company last week, with the plan incorporate the company as an intermediate to long-term addition, and either adding to the position if the company seems to be heading in the right direction or closing the position if it didn't seem to get its footing after a year or so.

However, in the week since I initiated the position, the stock has increased in value by nearly 60%. I don't think this was generally anticipated and it certainly wasn't what I foresaw. I can't locate any news or information that would explain or justify the price action, and I get uncomfortable when large unexplained movements happen in a price, good or bad.

So, I have to figure out what's going on and what should I do.

Is this a pump-and-dumps, meme stock, or trading fervor? If so, then I should calculate an exit point, close the position, count my blessings for my windfall, then re-evaluate the company again once the shenanigans subside.

On the other hand, is this a potentially great company in which people are simply excited to invest? Sure, there will be the inevitable pullbacks as people lock up gains, but will this company continue to have an overall upward trajectory and with it a huge upside? In that case, I would want to be increasing my position as soon as possible on the chance that I'm on the ground floor of a great investing opportunity.

Therefore, the basic question I started this post to ask is, when is the time to consider increasing your position in a company, when the initial investment isn't behaving in the way you expected? How do you determine when to increase your position when a stock is on an upturn? Or do you never buy more shares until there is a pause or downturn in the price?",1628277844

A couple questions I have though.  Can you sell your stake before the company goes public?  How would that work?  Is there a way to prevent people from selling their stake?  How does the 10% interest work?  Do they pay that out each year or something?  Or does it get rolled into the stock?

The [S&amp;P 500 P/B ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-book), rocketing to 4.73, up \~57% from March of 2020, is approaching levels not seen since just before the April 2020 market crash—in which the total market, continuing to decline into 2001-2002, lost 75% of its value from its 2000 high.  An increase in the gap between price and tangible book is often correlated with an increase in downward price pressure. That is, the further a given stock departs from its book value, the more likely it is to decline sharply in market price, particularly in response to market-wide adverse impacts, versus those securities trading closer to their book value.

**THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JULY 2021**

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 943,000 in July, and the unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage point to 5.4 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government education, and in professional and business services.

**Household Survey Data**

The unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage point to 5.4 percent in July, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 782,000 to 8.7 million. These measures are down considerably from their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession. However, they remain well above their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)

Among the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff fell by 572,000 to 1.2 million in July. This measure is down considerably from the high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 489,000 above the February 2020 level. The number of permanent job losers declined by 257,000 to 2.9 million in July but is 1.6 million higher than in February 2020. (See table A-11.)

The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) decreased by 560,000 in July to 3.4 million but is 2.3 million higher than in February 2020. These long-term unemployed accounted for 39.3 percent of the total unemployed in July. The number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks increased by 276,000 to 2.3 million. (See table A-12.)

The labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.7 percent in July and has remained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020. The participation rate is 1.6 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment- population ratio increased by 0.4 percentage point to 58.4 percent in July and is up by 1.0 percentage point since December 2020. However, this measure is 2.7 percentage points below its February 2020 level. (See table A-1.)

Among those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force, at 1.9 million, was little changed in July but is up by 435,000 since February 2020. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was 507,000 in July, down by 110,000 from the previous month but 106,000 higher than in February 2020. (See Summary table A.)

**Household Survey Supplemental Data**

In July, 13.2 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, down from 14.4 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically because of the pandemic.

**Establishment Survey Data**

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 943,000 in July, following a similar increase in June (+938,000). Nonfarm payroll employment in July is up by 16.7 million since April 2020 but is down by 5.7 million, or 3.7 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In July, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government education, and in professional and business services. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)

In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 11 cents to $30.54, following increases in the prior 3 months. Average hourly earnings for private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees also rose by 11 cents in July to $25.83. The data for recent months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)

In July, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.8 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 40.5 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)

The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up by 31,000, from +583,000 to +614,000, and the change for June was revised up by 88,000, from +850,000 to +938,000. With these revisions, employment in May and June combined is 119,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)",1628262955
49,investing,Zillow Q2 beats expectations. Potential good long buy?,"Summary of Q2

Zillow reported $1.3 billion in revenue Thursday for the second quarter, slightly beating analyst’s expectations.

Expected revenue was $1.28 billion, with earnings per share of 24 cents.

  Consolidated net income was $10 million.

The company’s Internet, Media, and Technology (IMT) segment grew 70% in revenue year-over-year to $476 million. Premier Agent revenue grew 82% year-over-year.

The Homes segment reached record revenue levels at $777 million.

The mortgages segment revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $57 million.

Zillow Group co-founder and CEO Rich Barton said the company expects recent housing market trends, including low interest rates and location-flexible job opportunities, to continue to fuel interest in Zillow.

The company’s mobile apps and websites saw 229 million average monthly unique users in the second quarter, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. This drove visits to 2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year.

The company ended the quarter with cash and investments totaling $4.6 billion.

Personal Notes:

1. Who can compete with Z?
2. Can they take over real-estate business in the long-term with direct home sales?
3. Does any other company have a sophisticated algo designed to buy homes like Z does?
4. Current MC us about 29 billion. What do you expect it to be in 5 years? 10 years?",1628262679

The drug has a new mechanism of action that is different from benzos, and has shown to have minimal side effects and be non-addictive in trials thus far.

Here are more resources about PH94B:

Depression and anxiety are two major areas of need in the world today. Many drugs that are currently approved to treat these disorders dont work well or have significant side effects.

People have been saying the ADR/VIE structure is dangerous because technically you own a shell company in the Cayman Islands and not the actual company and there’s no protection for you as an investor.. which I admit is fair and true. 

But people on here for whatever reason don’t realize both of these companies trade in Hong Kong, on the Hong Kong Exchange (H-Shares) Tickers: HK0700 and HK9988.. 

Owning the H-Shares is actually owning a piece of the company and you are taking a piece of risk off the table. If the US ever decided to delist, they’d be delisting the ADR’s, they have no jurisdiction over the H-Shares. If China ever decided to pull the companies out of US Markets, again, that only affects the ADR’s and not the H-Shares..

Point being, not investing in these two companies for that reason alone is not a good reason. You don’t like China? Don’t like Chinese stocks for various other reasons? Fine.. but there are other safer ways to buy shares of the companies..

19,investing,"Innovators in Pharma Sectors See Potential, Promise in Providing Improved Treatments"," 

NEW YORK, Aug. 5, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A leading cause of death in the United States for men and women of most racial and ethnic groups, heart disease is a pervasive health challenge that destroys lives. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that one person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease. Treating the disease, **as well as the conditions related to it such as high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a** top priority for those in the medical space, and innovative companies are looking for ways to provide even more effective treatments. A leader in hypertension innovation, **Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (**NASDAQ: LEXX**) (**Profile**)** is focused on using its patented DehydraTECH(TM) drug delivery to identify safe and affordable treatments to the approximately 108 million, or almost one-half, of American adults dealing with high blood pressure. Innovation is a key characteristic of any successful company working in the pharma space, and other companies that are recognized as innovation leaders include **Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc** (NASDAQ: JAZZ), **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (NYSE: JNJ), **United Therapeutics Corporation** (NASDAQ: UTHR) and **Abbott Laboratorie**s (NYSE: ABT).

* **Hypertension is a primary risk factor for heart disease, a leading cause of death in** **the United States.**
* **Lexaria is an innovator in the space, developing potential treatments utilizing its proprietary** **DehydraTECH technology.**
* **LEXX has identified three main areas to focus on, including pharmaceuticals and the treatment of heart disease.**
* **Early reports from the company's most recent human clinical study show DehydraTECH technology demonstrated rapid, sustained drop in blood pressure.**

**Hypertension News Isn't All Bad**

**While the CDC reports that** nearly half of all adults in the United States, or 108 million, have hypertension, only about 24% of those have their condition under control. In fact, many don't even know they have it. **Yet controlling blood pressure is critical to good health.**

High blood pressure is often a primary or cause of death in almost 500,000 deaths a year, with hypertension potentially doubling the risk of a heart attack and quadrupling the chance of having a stroke; the condition can also increase the chances of heart failure, vision loss, renal disease, dementia, peripheral artery disease, and more. And it's not just a problem for ""old-people""; nearly one in four adults between the ages of 20 to 44 have high blood pressure. **In addition,** high blood pressure costs the United States about $131 billion each year.

But the news isn't all bad. Hypertension can be managed — and even cured — with proper diagnosis and treatment. It should come as no surprise then that the global anti-hypertensive drug market is projected to grow from $24.17 billion in 2020 to $27.81 billion in 2025. Even with current hypertension drugs available, only 24% of the 108 million people in the U.S. with high blood pressure have their condition under control. It's a market ripe for innovation**.**

**Drug-Delivery Platform Shows Exciting Potential**

Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (NASDAQ: LEXX) looks to be a leader in some of the most exciting innovation happening in the treatment of high blood pressure. The Kelowna, British Columbia-based company has identified, developed and patented a new drug-delivery platform. The proprietary tech, called DehydraTECH technology, has been proven to increase the speed of onset, bioavailability, and potency of a variety of substances.

The mechanics involve combining an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with fatty acid oil and then applying the mix to carrier particles, which can be common ingredients such as tapioca starch or gum arabic. Next, a patented dehydration synthesis procedure is completed, resulting in a powder or liquid that can be used in the desired final form factor, such as a pill, tablet, chewable or oil.

Recognizing the potential for this new innovation, Lexaria has worked  with National Research Council of Canada, the biggest R&amp;D organization in the country, since 2017. The partnership has focused on defining the qualities of DehydraTECH, including that Nuclear Magnetic Resonance molecular characterization suggests DehydraTECH does not change the chemical structure of an API it delivers. This is essential when considering reliance on original API safety data in developing novel delivery methods without starting from scratch regarding the FDA process, which opens the door to a faster path to market.

Bottom line, this means that DehydraTECH could make lower doses of some substances more effective while potentially reducing side effects**.** With this in mind, the company has identified three areas in which to focus ongoing research and development; one of those areas is pharmaceuticals and the treatment of heart disease.

**Early Study Results Confirm DehydraTECH Promise**

As part of that R&amp;D, Lexaria recently released results from a human clinical study using DehydraTECH technology that indicated a rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure along with excellent tolerability. ""We are very encouraged by these early results in our 2021 hypertension program,"" said Lexaria CEO Chris Bunka. ""Lexaria's technology enabled a rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure, especially systolic pressure and particularly in stage 2 hypertensive volunteers.""

The early report noted that initial study results show a reduction in blood pressure in both male and female volunteers; the decrease was most pronounced in the first 10–50 minutes of the study treatment, reinforcing pre-existing findings demonstrating that DehydraTECH delivers superior performance over generic controls. Lead investigator on the study Dr. Phil Ainslie reported that ""these early results are extremely promising in this at-risk hypertensive population and provide a fundamental support for expansion into more prolonged repeat dosing and future longer term clinical trials.

**Diversification Creates Widespread Interest**

In addition to its work on heart disease and hypertension, Lexaria is also studying the potential impact DehydraTECH might have on reduced-risk noncombusted nicotine and improved antiviral drug delivery. Several successes in the company's diverse pipeline have been reported, in including in the antiviral program where DehydraTECH was used to process compounds from leading drugs used for antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS. This work holds particular promise in the current treatment of COVID-19 as well as looking forward and being better prepared in the future for future, inevitable pandemic situations**.**

The potential for use in a diverse group of market opportunities could create widespread interest in DehydraTECH possibilities. An example is today's antivirals market, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and the circulating delta variant; the market is currently estimated at $52.1 billion with projections to reach $66.7 billion by 2025. And that is only the beginning; DehydraTECH's versatility points to many other potential applications, including human hormones (e.g., testosterone and estrogen replacement, a $21.9 billion market); oral mucosal nicotine (global smokeless tobacco products market valued at $13.6 billion in 2018); vitamin D3 ($1.1 billion market); PDE5 inhibitors ($4.4 billion market in 2014); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ($15.6 billion market in 2019).

**Success Follows Innovation in Pharma Space**

Lexaria is leading the way in hypertension innovation, where research and discovery could not only save lives but also deliver significant profits. The $92.4 billion cardiovascular drug market generates billions of dollars every year for successful drug makers. Other big pharma companies are looking to innovate in other promising markets as well.

**Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (**NASDAQ: JAZZ**)** recently announced the Health Canada approval and availability of Vyxeos(R) for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. A cancer of the bone marrow and blood, Considered a rare disease, AML affects approximately 1,100 men and women in Canada annually, and though the number of AML cases continues to rise, current treatment regimens have remained the same for decades until now. ""As a company dedicated to bringing life-changing medicines to market and redefining possibilities, the approval  of Vyxeos in Canada represents Jazz's promise of putting patients first,"" said Paul Petrelli, general manager of Jazz Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.

Johnson and Johnson Innovation, a division of **Johnson &amp; Johnson (**NYSE: JNJ**)** dedicated to innovating in the medical space, recently announced the extension of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation Partnering Office. The office is located at Monash University's Clayton Campus in Melbourne and works in collaboration with the Victorian state government. This joint initiative between Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, the Victorian Government and Monash University will be extended for approximately two years through June 30, 2023. The agreement will allow the group to continue connecting with the Victorian innovation ecosystem, nurturing and accelerating innovative research, new product development and commercialization for a global market.

**United Therapeutics Corporation (**NASDAQ: UTHR**)** announced in June that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its New Drug Application (NDA) for Tyvaso DPI(TM) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Tyvaso DPI is a next-generation, dry-powder formulation of Tyvaso. If approved, Tyvaso DPI is expected to provide a more convenient method of administration as compared with traditional nebulized Tyvaso therapy.

**Abbott (**NYSE: ABT**)** received clearance this week from the FDA for its latest optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging platform powered by the company's new Ultreon software. This innovative imaging software combines OCT with artificial intelligence (AI) to provide physicians an enhanced, comprehensive view of coronary blood flow and blockages to assist physician decision-making and provide the best pathway for treatment. The company's Ultreon software integrates with Abbott's new Dragonfly OpStar imaging catheter and PressureWire X guidewire to provide physicians access to a broad set of tools to assess coronary blood flow and blockages and improve treatment planning for patients.  

Innovation — in the high blood pressure space as well as other compelling sectors in the pharma world — has the potential to deliver huge dividends. Most important, of course, is lives that are literally saved and quality of life that is enhanced, but triumph in billion-dollar markets can provide added incentive for success.

22,investing,Virgin Galactic reports loss – Q2 2021,"Virgin Galactic reported its fiscal Q2 2021 results on August 5. It  announced earnings of $ -0.39 per share with revenue of $0.571 million.

In July, the Company completed an “at-the-market” equity offering  program (the “ATM Offering”). In connection with the ATM Offering, the  Company filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission to offer and sell up to $500 million of shares of  the Company’s common stock from time to time. The Company ultimately  generated $500 million in gross proceeds through the sale of  approximately 13.7 million shares of common stock. The Company intends  to use the net proceeds generated from the ATM Offering for general  corporate purposes, with a priority on expansion of its spaceship fleet.

23,investing,Trying to understand Personal Rate of Return with company retirement account.,"I have a retirement account with TIAA and I can't tell if they calculate my contributes into the rate of return.  If they do, then I feel the rate is being illustrated as higher than it actually is.  This is their language on how they calculate the return rate:

*Your personal rate of return is the amount gained or lost divided by cash flow, which includes your contributions or withdrawals.
 
The contributions or withdrawals are aggregated each month and then time-weighted to the 15th of the month. This estimates the changes in your balance compared to market movement.
 
Here's an example with a contribution:
 
Beginning balance (January 1st):                      $100,000.00
       Contribution in March:                        +$15,000.00
               Weighted contribution          $11,958.90
     Market gain                                             +$20,000.00
Ending balance (December 31st):                       $135,000.00
Personal annualized rate of return:                          17.9%

In this example, there is a $15,000 contribution made in March, and calculated as of  the 15th of March, which creates an annual weighting multiple of .7973. This represents the net market movement divided by the amount of the balance affected by the market movement.
 
Here’s the formula of the actual calculation:
 
PRR = (Ending balance - beginning balance - total cash flow)                
Divided by: (Beginning balance + total weighted cash flow)
Multiplied by: 100*

I understand you have to add the amount of the contributions to the base for the return, but I think they are saying my contributions are counted as returns, which doesn't make sense to me.  Can anyone clarify this for me?",1628196124

The company reports ADR, Occupancy Rate, RevPAR for maybe 30% of their brands, they've gone with an ""asset-light"" growth plan. They're selling their owned properties and doing management/franchise agreements instead. They get % of revenue from management/franchised hotels, and some incentive fees. I'm wondering whether I should attempt to take the ADR information for brands, number of rooms, and build revenue generated by the brands, then apply the % of revenue for management/franchise (the third party who actually owns the hotel gets majority of the revenue). 

I'm wondering what the professional's models look like. Do they just do previous year with a growth rate, or do they go brand level? Brand level would allow for seeing which brands in a segment may outperform competitors?",1628180677

Graham Tanaka is another large investor, initiated a position a couple of years ago and has put out some brilliant articles/videos about its potential.

Amyris just posted their Q2 results (https://investors.amyris.com/2021-08-05-Amyris,-Inc-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results).
With the shenanigans happening at ZY, this quarter and future outlook solidify why AMRS is the leader in the industry and has at least a 5yr competitive advantage compared to its peers. Being able to scale your molecules is key. AMRS has a proven track record of scaling but now has shown ability to create a B2C channel for surplus inventory while realizing 100x profit margin improvement by creating private brands and going directly to consumer. Some of these brands are the fastest growing in their category (Pippette, Biossance) with 5 new brands ready to launch this quarter (Terasana launches tomorrow, Aug 6). 

Expected $2 BILLION in sales revenue by 2025 announced today. That's just from this current portfolio. Any revenue generated from new molecules (~6 new ones / yr) is bonus! Current market cap roughly $4.2b.

Production is their biggest bottleneck. Update provided today that their new facility in Brazil is on track for completion this year and should be producing in Q1 2022. ANOTHER new facility will start construction once this one's completed. Impressive to be able to strengthen the financials while growing like this.Total debt at the end of the quarter was $105 million, compared to $176 million at the end of Q2 2020. Expected to be below $100 million end of year, $50m of which converible to equity.

In a nutshell, $MX is a stock with a current outstanding buyout offer at $29.  It is trading at $21 because the government is looking into it.  You are betting on the merger going through.  If it passes the gov's scrutiny, I see us popping to at least $26, maybe up to $29.  **Let me know if you see a downside I'm not seeing.**

# Company Overview

So what is Magnachip. Magnachip, $MX, is a semi-conductor company based in South Korea that produces OLED display drivers as well as power management integrated circuits. Their OLED tech goes into smartphones, TVs, as well as automobiles. Their power integrated circuits are used in automotive, 5g, and the energy industry. The company pulled in about 500M in revenue last year and has been around for 15 years and owns a portfolio of approximately 1,200 registered patents and pending applications. So it's not a non-sense vapor-ware company. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html)

# Why Magnachip

Magnachip is supposedly such a good investment that two firms have offered to buyout Magnachip one at $29 and one at $35.

* Wiseroad Capital offered to buy the firm at at $29: [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12246/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12246/html)
* Cornucopia Investment Partners offers to buy the firm at $35: [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12406/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12406/html)

**Note that Magnachip is trading at $21 right now. 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮**

The reason why $MX is trading at $21 right now as opposed to $29 is because the US government (as well as South Korean government) has stepped in to 'review' this buyout. They don't want to lose another semiconductor company to China. Wiseroad Capital is a Chinese private equity firm. And China = Very Bad. So buying $MX means you take on the risk that the deal falls through cuz US gov thinks China = Bad.

**With that said, even with that risk, IMO, it makes sense to buy $MX** 🚀🚀. Here are a few reasons.

* I already mentioned that big boy professionals value this stock at $29 and $35. This isn't some random analyst saying it should be worth $X. This is an actual offer and someone is willing to drop billions on this company. With that said, even without the offers do some Googling and you can see that average price target for $MX is around $26.
* The merger announcement with Magnachip occurred at the end of March 2021 (although some say there had been whispers since January), sending $MX from about $20 to $26. **We are now basically at the same price PRIOR to the merger announcement**. And if you think the whispers occurred in Jan (I can't find any articles, then pre-merger price is $18). The press release cites $18.83. Regardless, either most people think that the merger is not going to happen, or this stock is a victim of the tech/small cap crash we've seen in the past month. But we are basically at pre-merger prices.
* $MX already accepted a deal from Wiseroad and it is just subject to review. According to SA, If the merger is terminated because, MX accepts a superior proposal, it would be required to pay $42.1 million (roughly 3 percent of the transaction value) to Wise Road. If the deal is terminated for the following, Wise Road is required to pay MX the respective termination fee: $70.2 million (5 percent) for failing to receive U.S. regulatory approval, $84.3 million (6 percent) for failure to receive South Korean regulatory approval, and $105.3 million (7.5 percent) for any other reason notwithstanding U.S. and South Korean approvals. **In OTHER WORDS, even IF, the deal falls through, $MX will get paid.**
* Also, even if this deal falls through, it's not unlikely that another investment firm will try to buy out $MX. Or, $MX just does so well in the next few years that it eventually trades at $29.

Do I think the deal will go through? Honestly, I'm just an ape so no idea. But note that most of Magnachip's sales are to Samsung as well as to companies in China. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html)

Meaning, it rarely sells to companies in the US. In other words, from a trade and technological standpoint, the US doesn't stand to lose much if China does end up owning the company. South Korea, could stand to lose out. But Wiseroad was willing to give up 84M if South Korea does not approve the deal.

**So when is the deal expected to go through**? Some say by the end of this year. But recently, the US announced that it plans to be done with it's part of the review by 9/13. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12486/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12486/html)

As for when South Korea will be done? Who knows. I'd imagine it would be shortly after . OR, South Korea may have even been ok with it in the first place, and are just waiting for the US. Who knows.

But the deadline to keep in mind is 9/13, and obviously it could be A LOT SOONER. Personally, I'm thinking, if the buyout gets OKed, $MX goes to $26 after confirmation and then goes to $29 eventually. But, if it falls through, it may eventually be bought out for even more! Someone was willing to pay $35 at one point.

My point is that if you know what you are doing or more or less know what you are doing, it is very unlikely you will lose everything you've invested. You may lose 20% of your money invested, for instance I did when I started investing. It is also true that for each person it is different, but in my case, I had about 1400€ ($1657) and started investing with 500€ and then after a few months of that going well I put in another 500€ and 200€ into crypto. If I had only put 500€, which I am willing to lose, then I just wouldn't be making that much money and it would be much harder to make a decent amount of money.

In conclusion, I think one should invest an amount which you could afford to lose half of that amount. I just find it very hard to lose everything that you have invested in. Even if there's a crash and you hold and you pannick sell at the bottom, that's a -50% or -60% at most.

39,investing,Tesla AI day scheduled for August 19th.,"With AI Day approaching in a few weeks, Tesla has started sending out invitations to the highly-anticipated event. Tesla’s invitations, including the wording in its RSVP page, suggest that the company may be discussing some interesting topics for AI Day. 

Immediately noticeable in the AI Day invites is an image showing what seems to be a [**stack of computer hardware**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-dojo-chip-images-dennis-hong/). Very little is known about this yet-to-be-announced hardware, though it was initially teased by legendary mechanical engineer Dennis Hong online. This fueled speculations that the image was likely related to Tesla’s Dojo Supercomputer, which would be used to train Autopilot software. 

A look at the RSVP page for the event shows a rather interesting description of the upcoming event. 

*“Join us in Palo Alto, CA on August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PDT. This invite-only event will feature a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more. Attendees will be among the first to see our latest developments in supercomputing and neural network training. They’ll also get an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.*

*“If you have received an email invitation for this event, please submit the form below using the same email address to let us know you’d like to attend. Space is limited, and we will be confirming the attendee list closer to the event date. If you are chosen to attend AI Day, you will receive an email confirmation with additional event details.”*

Arguably the most noticeable portion from AI Day’s RSVP page is the sentence referencing what is “next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.” Granted, Tesla is also using its software prowess for its energy products with products like Autobidder, but Elon Musk has also noted in the past that long term, people would likely think of Tesla as an [**AI robotics company**](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/news/tesla-begins-sending-out-ai-day-invitations).

48,investing,Could Alibaba and Tencent be Berkshire material?,"I know Warren has often tried to stay away from companies he can’t understand easily, but the valuations in these two companies right now are astronomically low. Plus in regards to Aliabab I wouldn’t say their business is really that hard to understand, it’s Tencent that is more complex with more branches to the company. Tencent is much more of a conglomerate than Alibaba and I don’t think Warren being as smart as he is would have a hard time seeing the opportunity in Alibaba. 

I just look at it from the perspective of they’re cheap, they’re growing exponentially still, they’re liquid and big enough for Berkshire Hathaway to make big moves in. The only negative is the political risk of course, but it hasn’t always stopped Warren and Charlie, they bought BYD and that has been a tremendous investment for them. 

Also I realize Munger has a position in Alibaba in his personal company, so theoretically at least one of them seems to agree with it. I also understand that Greg Abel is probably more involved than ever in these decisions and I don’t know where he stands on things.

Link: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03

Noteworthy Excerpts: 

&gt; Let me start at the beginning. 

It was Halloween night 2008, in the middle of the financial crisis, when Satoshi Nakamoto published an eight-page paper[1] on a cypherpunk mailing list that’d been run by cryptographers since 1992.[2]

Nakamoto — we still don’t know who she, he, or they were — wrote, “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”[3]

Nakamoto had solved two riddles that had dogged these cryptographers and other technology experts for a couple of decades: first, how to move something of value on the internet without a central intermediary; and relatedly, how to prevent the “double-spending” of that valuable digital token.

Subsequently, his innovation spurred the development of crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology.

Based upon Nakamoto’s innovation, about a dozen years later, the crypto asset class has ballooned. As of Monday, this asset class purportedly is worth about $1.6 trillion, with 77 tokens worth at least $1 billion each and 1,600 with at least a $1 million market capitalization.[4]

/

&gt;We already live in an age of digital public monies — the dollar, euro, sterling, yen, yuan. If that wasn’t obvious before the pandemic, it has become eminently clear over the last year that we increasingly transact online.

Such public fiat monies fulfill the three functions of money: a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.

No single crypto asset, though, broadly fulfills all the functions of money.

Primarily, crypto assets provide digital, scarce vehicles for speculative investment. Thus, in that sense, one can say they are highly speculative stores of value.

These assets haven’t been used much as a unit of account.

We also haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange. To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions, and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with Colonial Pipeline.

With the advent of the internet age and the movement from physical money to digital money several decades ago, nations around the globe layered various public policy goals over our digital public money system.

/

The SEC has a three-part mission — to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets in between them. We focus on financial stability as well. But at our core, we’re about investor protection.

If you want to invest in a digital, scarce, speculative store of value, that’s fine. Good-faith actors have been speculating on the value of gold and silver for thousands of years.

Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West.

This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications. There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.

If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.

First, many of these tokens are offered and sold as securities.

There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front. In the 1930s, Congress established the definition of a security, which included about 20 items, like stock, bonds, and notes. One of the items is an investment contract.

The following decade, the Supreme Court took up the definition of an investment contract. This case said an investment contract exists when “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”[6] The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this Howey Test.

Further, this is but one of many ways we determine whether tokens must comply with the federal securities laws.

I think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: “To the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities — and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security — we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.”[7]

I find myself agreeing with Chairman Clayton. You see, generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects. I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.

This leaves prices open to manipulation. This leaves investors vulnerable.

Over the years, the SEC has brought dozens of actions in this area,[8] prioritizing token-related cases involving fraud or other significant harm to investors. We haven’t yet lost a case.

Moreover, there are initiatives by a number of platforms to offer crypto tokens or other products that are priced off of the value of securities and operate like derivatives.

Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These products are subject to the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.

I’ve urged staff to continue to protect investors in the case of unregistered sales of securities.

Next, I’d like to discuss crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and other “decentralized finance” (DeFi) platforms.

The world of crypto finance now has platforms where people can trade tokens and other venues where people can lend tokens. I believe these platforms not only can implicate the securities laws; some platforms also can implicate the commodities laws and the banking laws.

A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.

Moreover, unlike other trading markets, where investors go through an intermediary like the New York Stock Exchange, people can trade on crypto trading platforms without a broker — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from around the globe.

Further, while many overseas platforms state they don’t allow U.S. investors, there are allegations that some unregulated foreign exchanges facilitate trading by U.S. traders who are using virtual private networks, or VPNs.[9]

The American public is buying, selling, and lending crypto on these trading, lending, and DeFi platforms, and there are significant gaps in investor protection.

Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption.

Make no mistake: If a lending platform is offering securities, it also falls into SEC jurisdiction.",1628100480

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/price-book)

And a quote from Warren Buffett explaining some key parts.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years)

Basically - how much a stock can return to its shareholders is revealed by the price-to-book ratio. Buffett explains just how this works but take him at his word for it.

In a nutshell, if a company earns $1 at a P/B of 1.00 then it can return $1 to its shareholders.

If the P/B is too high, then that company must enlarge buybacks (less than ideal) or dividends (worst option) to return value to its shareholders.

MSFT was well within normal limits of P/B up until this recent run. This recent run has entirely demolished its P/B.

* Historical P/B \~ 3.0
* Current P/B \~ 15+

What this means is that MSFT cannot possibly return value to its shareholders like it used to. The value now exists solely in the price it is currently at. And MSFT doesn't appear to have a way to dig out of this hole.

Its revenue per employee is declining, not increasing, and its future growth rate is flat, not increasing therefore not justifying the recent valuation.

To be honest, bravo to whoever made money on the recent MSFT run - but based on the resultant damage to its P/B ratio - I can't say that the return was justified fundamentally.

Plenty of other stocks including Buffetts and MSFT before the last 2 years returned great value to their shareholders without blowing-up their P/B.

When the P/B is high there's only one place to go...down - or sideways while bleeding off excess cash in stock buybacks or dividends.",1628099748

87,investing,EV demand - Power grid and generation has to grow A LOT,"Gasoline represents 16% of all energy produced in the US: [https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/use-of-gasoline.php#:\~:text=In%202020%2C%20total%20gasoline%20consumption,of%20total%20U.S.%20energy%20consumption](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/use-of-gasoline.php#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20total%20gasoline%20consumption,of%20total%20U.S.%20energy%20consumption).

The efficiency of EVs offsets some of this burden: [https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/what-is-mpge#:\~:text=Kilowatt%2Dhours%20is%20the%20standard,per%20gallon%20to%20be%20equivalent](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/what-is-mpge#:~:text=Kilowatt%2Dhours%20is%20the%20standard,per%20gallon%20to%20be%20equivalent).

By about 50% if we are conservative.

So we can say that the US is 8% short on energy production during a conversion from gas to EVs.

An 8% shortage would have huge cost implications on the electric utilities sector since they are not flexible in raising rates but instead are rate-limited usually by law.

There are 22,731 electric generators in the US at 10,346 faciliies: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=65&amp;t=2#:\~:text=How%20many%20power%20plants%20are,least%201%20megawatt%20(MW)](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=65&amp;t=2#:~:text=How%20many%20power%20plants%20are,least%201%20megawatt%20(MW)).

This means we need 1,819 more generators at 830 more facilities.

What does this cost?

[https://proest.com/construction/cost-estimates/power-plants/](https://proest.com/construction/cost-estimates/power-plants/)

It's variable depending on where the generators are built (and yes - solar is considered a generator in power terms) Solar for example cost $9,000,000,000 for 341 generators only producing 3,100 MW.

We don't need to get too far into the weeds.

A lot of power in the US comes from Natural Gas and it is $5,300,000,000 per 74 generators adding 4,755 MW.

So if we take Natural gas to be a kind of midline in cost then the US needs to add:

**$130,279,729,729** worth of power to the grid to convert from gasoline consumption to EVs.

I think this is a significant head-wind to EV growth when the power generation starts to get strained and people actually realize they need to spend money on power generation instead of building oil wells.

This will give BIG OIL some staying power (longer than some think).

And it provides opportunity for investment into electric utilities at some point before this critical understanding is realized.",1628094654
90,investing,EV charging infrastructure companies,"With the coming growth in electric vehicles - I don't see this as an if anymore but merely just how soon - I expect that more consumers will want to buy home-based chargers. Also, there will be a need for more charging stations away from home. This leads me to think that buying stock in a company that makes the actual charging *equipment* could be a good investment.

I have been able to find a fair amount of [material on investing](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/02/should-you-buy-electric-vehicle-charging-stocks-ri/) (or advice not to invest) in charging networks such as ChargePoint, but I can't seem to find a lot of detail about which companies make the equipment itself.

95,investing,Question about when to take profits,"I have always heard to make sure that you lock in some profits when a stock that you purchased has gained in value. The question I have is does that still make sense if you still want to be in the position? Let’s say for instance I am up 50% on a stock that I purchased less than a year ago. Does it make sense for me to close my position to “lock in the profits” and re-buy into the stock? I just don’t see the point in that because for one, I’m paying capital gains tax on the profits within a year of holding and then I’m basically still owning the same amount of stock. 

Would the only time I actually lock in profits be for if I no longer want to have a position in the stock?",1628089329

10,investing,Companies are capitalizing on the ongoing gold trend,"With the evolving gold demands, companies are definitely moving fast to get their hands on it. The gold market has brought a more diverse set of consumers and investors, which make it a picture of diversity and constant growth.

The demand for gold has been driven not only by cultural changes, but also by the income growth in some of the world’s most dynamic and rapidly growing economies. This brings me to the observation that gold seems to be on the roll, since I always encounter gold stocks trends in a lot of subreddits that I come across.

Big companies like Newmont Corporation ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/)) basically have the largest gold reserve base in the industry. Their gold mines include Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.

They acquired GT Gold too, which only improved their portfolio significantly, since GT Gold has the Tatogga project in the highly sought after Golden Triangle District of British Columbia, Canada. They recently enhanced their portfolio with the approval of the Ahafo North Project in Ghana.

There are junior players out there that are showing promise as well. Take Collective Mining ([CNL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)) for example, who has been working on potentially valuable gold projects. They are more than ready to capitalize on the trend with their Guayabales and San Antonio projects all found in Colombia. In fact, they recently discovered a high grade silver channel sampling at the Box Target.

The company also had another development a few weeks back, with their initial channel sampling campaign at the Donut target (“Donut”) within the Guayabales Project has returned high-grade gold and silver assay results from a shallow underground tunnel.

Seeing how gold mining companies are taking advantage of the trend in gold stocks, I think we can expect more people investing I guess. Tons of stock threads are all over reddit, so it seems like people have been really trying to take advantage and make sure they get some good earnings from it.",1628083036

34,investing,PSA: Missinformation about Chinese Stocks floating about everywhere. Do your own research!,"I have been fighting to correct the missinformation in the last week in the comments but I decided a dedicated thread could be useful for Investors.

Lets look at Alibaba as an example to explain what I mean. You can find all this information on their 20-F. This is my source.

**ADR vs HK shares**
The BABA ADR can be exchanged 1:8 for the HK stock for ALIBABA Holding. There is no substantial risk when it comes to ADR vs the HK stock. If BABA gets delisted in NYSE then you can still convert them to HK shares.

**ADR vs VIE**

Alibaba Holding directly ownes all the non Chinese parts of ALIBABA. They are also directly owning some of the chinese parts of ALIBABA. The CCP only restricts foreign investments into certain sectors. In all other sectors foreigners can and do have direct ownership rights. There are three categories of sectors. Sectors in which foreign investers can invest freely. Sectors in which foreign investors can hold no more then 50% of total equity. And sectors in which foreign investors can not hold any equity.

Only a part of Alibaba is not directly or indirectly owned by Alibaba Holdings. For this part they have the VIE contracts. These contracts say that Alibaba Holdings has control over the profits of these Companys and can replace the CEO. Although it is not clear if the contract is enforceable under chinese LAW (grey area).

The following parts of ALIBABA are not Part of ALIBABA Holdings and have a VIE contract instead:
-Zhejiang Taobao Network Co Ltd
-Zhejiang Tmal Network Co Ltd
-Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd
-Youku Information Technology Co Ltd
These parts currently make less then 50% of total revenue.

70,investing,Is precious metal swapping an effective investment strategy ?,"So I just watched a video on an interesting investing strategy called precious metal swapping where the idea is you look at long term charts of the ratios of the five precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and rhodium) compared to each other, and buy when the ratios are historically cheap then sell when they're historically overvalued  (and then use those gains to buy another precious metal that's historically cheap). 

The video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPMngisOEM&amp;t=578s&amp;ab\_channel=FindingValueFinance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPMngisOEM&amp;t=578s&amp;ab_channel=FindingValueFinance), outlines a scenario where if you had started in 2000 and traded based off the ratios for the next 20 years, you would've made a 38.6% annualized return. This figure is skewed a bit high due to him not taking premiums when buying/selling precious metals into account, but surely the return would still be much higher than the S&amp;P 500, right?

Proterra (PTRA): IPO’d this year. Manufacturer of electric buses with customers ranging from colleges and universities to National Parks to cities in the US for local transportation. Also breaking into the school bus and commercial vehicle markets. 

Corsair Gaming (CRSR): a company from my opinion (and the opinion of many analysts) is INCREDIBLY underrated. With gaming/streaming expecting to grow rapidly over the next few years, this company provides a lot of the equipment necessary for it. 

Coinbase (COIN): Crypto wallet with more uses than just buying and selling cryptocurrencies. I’m a big believer in Ethereum so I like the support for DEFI and Dapps.

18,investing,Do I want to own shares of SQ....,"I just can't evaluate companies like SQ or TSLA. SQ is on my short-list, but it's PEG isn't amazing, it's P/E is through the roof. So is TSLA, and TSLA has proved for seemingly years now - never short TSLA.

SQ seems like a similar company but seems to me to be in an even better financial position than TSLA.

So when looking for tech sector, future sector (we can dub it?), I compare SQ to AAPL and MSFT, both have done amazingly well recently while staying in traditional norms of P/E and PEG ratios and are more quantifiable.

So what about SQ? Is someone who looks at these, can they walk us through why to own SQ and not just buy MSFT? Is there real downside risk? Can the carpet be pulled out like GME and AMC which are obvious garbage?

Or is SQ a solid company and it basically keeps the territory it takes?",1628001261
19,investing,Is Goldman Sachs a better return. MSFT/AAPL/GS,"I'm leaning toward GS because it has a few unique characteristics going for it. It's IV is good - on par with Tech, it's price is high which raises premium further, unlike AAPL and MSFT it isn't making giant runs which makes it harder to predict, and it also pays out \~2.3% dividend which acts like a keel to price fluctuation.

Right now the annualized return for 15.9% in premiums on GS is at 0% chance of being assigned. I think Probability calculators are a bit wonky though so I look at the gamma weighted strikes and most of the weight is around 375, which means for a \~16% annualized return on bi-weeklies you have a very high chance (even with the delta around 0.30) of not even getting assigned or getting assigned near a top that you can buy back in at or wait for a dip.

MSFT is \~45% probability of assignment for 11.4% annualized return.

AAPL is about the same (trading in tandem) and about 12.8% annualized return.

So I think GS has a pretty strong, relatively risk free, money piñata that largely unable to be seen unless you look at the options chains and the Greeks.

Given their dividend payouts are small - MSFT and AAPL both have to make up an approximately 6% gap in return on their share price if you take the risk of \~45% assignment to earn the annualized rate of return on premiums mentioned above. And I think that may be do-able, by share price both AAPL and MSFT are juggernauts of return.

But, then it comes down to if ones strategy should be to seek out ores of premium. And GS somehow seems to fall into a vein of gold.

A bit about the sector differences. I think Tech is waning into a mature state for the supposed bull run of the fall-to-spring season. But, given the inflationary environment, banks are tee'd well for a stronger-than-average bull run.

I've read differing opinions on why future rate hikes aren't raising the 10yr rate over the 2yr rate yet, and the argument I lean upon is the liquidity that a lot of big players are sitting on, they are still gobbling up the 2years driving their prices up relatively to 10year.

When that changes, the banks positions (less so GS but it trades tandem) will be much stronger than it appears now.",1627999758
29,investing,Best way to invest $6k for long-term growth?,"Howdy all! 

I recently transferred an old 401k into a Roth IRA account. The amount is a little over $6k. Initially I was thinking about divvying it up between a few different ETFs or maybe something with decent dividend payout (but as I understand it that can limit growth?), but then I came across REITs and potential reasons to have them in a Roth and decided it was worth asking other people for their opinions. 


At this time I’m leaning towards: GOOD, WPC, MRK, SCHD, JEPI, and O for no reason other than coming across them in my (very inexperienced and limited) research so far. 


Ideally, I want to get into some healthy, long-term positions that I can continue to add to over time. I’m currently 32 so I’ve got a while to let things marinate. Not afraid of a little risk, as I plan to monitor and re-assess every so often.

32,investing,"Alibaba misses revenue estimates as e-commerce growth slows, regulatory crackdown persists","(Reuters) -China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd missed analyst estimates for first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as its e-commerce business was hurt by rising competition from smaller players such as JD.Com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc.

Alibaba's results mirror those of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc in the United States, as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions has led to more consumers visiting physical stores rather than ordering online.

Core commerce revenue for Alibaba rose about 35% to 180.24 billion yuan in the quarter, compared with estimates of 184.23 billion yuan. In the fourth quarter, the unit's revenue was up more than 70%.

Overall, revenue rose about 34% to 205.74 billion yuan ($31.83 billion) in the first quarter ended June 30, below estimates for 209.39 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 45.14 billion yuan, compared with 47.59 billion yuan a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 16.60 yuan per share, above estimates for 14.43 yuan.

Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group, recorded a profit of about 13.48 billion yuan in the quarter ended March, according to the Chinese e-commerce giant's filing.

Alibaba, which holds about a third of Ant, posted a profit of 4.49 billion yuan for the quarter ended June 30 from its investments in the financial conglomerate.

Revenue in Alibaba's cloud computing division grew 29% year-on-year, reaching 16.05 billion yuan ($2.49 billion)

The results come amid an ongoing Chinese regulatory crackdown on industry, during which Alibaba has become one of the main targets.

Late last year, regulators halted a planned $37 billion IPO of Ant Group in Shanghai and subsequently called for a restructuring of the financial unit.

Later, in April, China's anti-monopoly regulator fined Alibaba $2.75 billion for engaging in anti-competitive practices.

During an earnings call with investors, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said the company would continue to monitor the impact of ongoing regulatory changes on the company's business.

He cited a recent regulatory crackdown on community marketplace platforms letting sellers offer items below market price as one example of a sector the company is monitoring.

""We are in the process of studying the regulatory requirements, evaluating the potential impacts on our relevant businesses and we will respond positively with actions,"" Zhang said.

60,investing,China regulator to probe auto chip distributors over price-gouging suspicions,"

SHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.

The action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.

""In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,"" the agency said.

The firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.

A global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.

Panic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.

In June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.

In April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.

Tencent Holdings Ltd. dived as much as 10% Tuesday after an offshoot of China’s official news agency decried the “spiritual opium” and “electronic drugs” of games, stoking fears Beijing will next set its sights on online entertainment.

The social media giant joined rivals NetEase Inc. and XD Inc. in an abrupt selloff in early Hong Kong trading after an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency published a blistering critique of the gaming industry. The Economic Information Daily cited a student as saying some schoolmates played Tencent’s Honor of Kings -- one of its most popular titles -- eight hours a day and called for stricter controls over time spent on games.

It spooked investors already on edge after Beijing came down hard on online industries from e-commerce to ride-hailing, triggering a global selloff of Chinese shares that at one point surpassed $1 trillion. Nervous investors continue to reevaluate their holdings as they ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent-backed Meituan and Didi Global Inc.

“No industry or sport should prosper by eradicating an entire generation,” the Xinhua article said, citing an academic at a state-backed institution.

1,investing,Square acquires Afterpay for $29B,"Square to buy Afterpay for US$29 billion to tap younger users

Square Inc., the digital-payments platform led by Twitter Inc. founder Jack Dorsey, agreed to buy Australian buy-now, pay-later company Afterpay Ltd. for US$29 billion in its largest-ever acquisition.

The all-stock offer values Afterpay shares at AUS$126.21 each, 31 per cent higher than Friday’s closing price of AUS$96.66, the companies said in a statement. Still, that’s less than Afterpay’s February high of AUS$158.47. The stock jumped as much as 29 per cent to AUS$125 in Sydney trading Monday.

Square said the buy-now, pay-later concept represents a chance to capitalize on a shift away from traditional credit, especially among younger consumers. The plan is for Square to integrate Afterpay into both its consumer Cash App, and its Seller product for small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said in an interview.

“It’s very different from the traditional consumer-financing business model,” Ahuja said, describing “buy now, pay later” as an “alternative” to traditional credit. “Since our founding days we have seen it as a key priority for our customers, whether merchants or consumers, to get fast access to funds,” she added, but declined to say whether Square would offer other traditional finance options, like a credit card.

Square shares were up about 3% in the first minutes of trading Monday in New York.

Afterpay lets consumers purchase items on credit and pay later with a series of installments. It’s particularly popular with younger consumers -- who may not have a credit card -- to buy clothes, beauty products and homewares. There are no fees or interest on the loan as long as people pay on time, according to Afterpay’s website.

The deal should also help boost Cash App’s total user base by adding Afterpay’s 16 million users to Cash App’s existing user base of 70 million annual users, Ahuja said.

Larger competitors have pushed into the market recently, adding to the challenges for Afterpay and its peers. Apple Inc. is teaming up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a buy now, pay later service that would be tied with Apple Pay, Bloomberg News reported in July. Afterpay shares fell 10 per cent the day following the report.

Afterpay shareholders may reject the proposed Square offer, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Matt Ingram and Regan Burrows wrote. They pointed out the offer is below the stock’s peak earlier this year and its growth is much faster than the U.S. company.

Under the proposed agreement, Afterpay co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar would join Square and help lead Afterpay’s merchant and consumer businesses as part of Square’s Seller and Cash App division.

The acquisition would be easily the biggest deal for an Australian company, eclipsing the US$16.6 billion a group of pension funds last month bid for Sydney Airport, only to have the offer rejected as too low.
Square recently launched its banking operations, including checking and savings accounts for small businesses, and offers loans. The addition of Afterpay also gives the digital payments company a chance to expand into consumer lending, which it doesn’t currently offer.

‘Shared Purpose’

“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose,” Dorsey said in the statement. “We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”

Square also reported second-quarter gross profit of US$1.14 billion, up 91 per cent year-over-year. Gross payment volume, or the total amount of payments processed on Square’s platform, increased 88 per cent to US$42.8 billion, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected US$36.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Square had been scheduled to release earnings Thursday.

Total revenue, including Bitcoin, was US$4.68 billion. Bitcoin revenue alone was US$2.72 billion, below the US$3.4 billion estimate by analysts. Square said Bitcoin revenue declined because of “relative stability in the price of Bitcoin, which affected trading activity compared to prior quarters.”
Afterpay was founded in 2015 and now has more than 1,300 employees globally, according to Molnar.
 
The board of Melbourne-based Afterpay unanimously recommended shareholders accept the deal, which the company said is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.",1627930478

**Its affordability** , with the Company offering affordable medical coverage plans , spanning low - cost basic plans to more expensive , but cost - effective , Premier and Prestige plans that provide a greater degree of coverage .

 

Clover Health generates revenue through the provision of health insurance and healthcare services to customers under US Government’s federal Medicare Advantage program .

The Company derives revenue in two principal streams :

* Revenue derived through the payment of premiums by the government under the Medicare Advantage program ;
* Revenue derived from health coverage subscriptions .

Clover Health offers insurance plans at three different levels .

This includes a basic plan that does not incur a monthly cost , as well a more extensive plans at the Premium and Prestige level , which cost around $ 40 and $ 178 per month respectively .

&amp;#x200B;

In other words , to focus on your health and the results of rather expensive treatments .

The goal of a direct contract CMS is to transfer more control to healthcare providers .

It is hoped that health / insurance providers will invest more in technology as incentives are aimed at improving health outcomes .

In this case , Clover Health already has an advantage over its competitors with its data - driven and AI -powered Clover Assistant software .

Clover Assistant is a key differentiator for the company .

Clover Health's home - based primary care program has been designed to improve the management of medically challenging cases .

This is especially useful for debilitated or bedridden elderly people with limited mobility .

Clover Health's home - based primary care program was able to reduce hospital admissions by 17 % and medical costs by an average of $ 325 per participant per month .

Clover Health believes that it will be able to expand its direct contract business to 200,000 beneficiaries in the near future .

By the end of 2021 , the company plans to reach between 70,000 and 100,000 beneficiaries .

DSCR has been on the move since the Company completed the agreement with Sierra Gold LLC. to acquire the Ruby Mining claims and commence mining operations.

The Ruby is also renowned for its production of course and jewelers-grade gold, with the largest gold nugget weighing 201 ounces or 17 pounds. It is conservatively estimated that 134,844 ounces of gold are available for near-term recovery from identified channels using the existing Ruby infrastructure. Placer refers to mining the buried watercourse riverbed at Ruby. There are 3.5 miles of river channels yet to be mined on the Ruby mining claims. Historically the channels have produced up to 106,000 oz per mile, indicating a potential of 370,000 oz of gold still to be mined from the buried placer.

The hopes for recovery from the pandemic fell flat with the resurgence of the new Delta variant. As the new Covid-19 cases rise across the globe, market investors and economists fear sloppy economic growth.   

First identified in India, Delta is now dominant in the U.K. and several other countries, including Germany, Italy, and France. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the variant is detected in 96 countries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified it as a variant ‘of concern’ and said delta accounts for 20% of all covid cases in the U.S.  

There has been uncertainty and doubts over the economic recuperation ever since the delta made its way.

A week ago, IHS Markit survey of American businesses reported that the new variant played a part in weighing on June factory output, particularly “in various emerging Asian economies.” 

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, says, “The Delta variant poses a major risk to the outlook. Not only have rising case numbers led to a slide in business optimism to the lowest since February, but further Covid waves around the world could also lead to further global supply-chain delays.”

**Conclusion**

	 CEO Patrick Gelsinger has been making some big moves these past couple of months. Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. 

	Intel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.

	Moore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.

	The U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.

	The global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.

**Abstract**

* The purpose of this report is to review the evidence on the profitability of technical analysis. To achieve this purpose, the report comprehensively reviews survey, theoretical and empirical studies regarding technical trading strategies.
* The survey literature indicates that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that about 30% to 40% of practitioners appear to believe that technical analysis is an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.
* We provide an overview of theoretical models that include implications about the profitability of technical analysis. Conventional efficient market theories, such as the martingale model and random walk models, rule out the possibility of technical trading profits in speculative markets, while relatively recent models such as noisy rational expectation models or behavioral models suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable due to noise in the market or investors’ irrational behavior
* Early studies indicated that technical trading strategies were profitable in foreign exchange markets and futures markets, but not in stock markets before the 1980s. Modern studies indicated that technical trading strategies consistently generated economic profits in a variety of speculative markets at least until the early 1990s. Among a total of 92 modern studies, 58 studies found positive results regarding technical trading strategies, while 24 studies obtained negative results. Ten studies indicated mixed results.
* Despite the positive evidence on the profitability of technical trading strategies, it appears that most empirical studies are subject to various problems in their testing procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

Technical analysis is a forecasting method of price movements using past prices, volume, and open interest.2 Pring (2002), a leading technical analyst, provides a more specific definition:

&gt;“The technical approach to investment is essentially a reflection of the idea that prices move in trends that are determined by the changing attitudes of investors toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological forces. The art of technical analysis, for it is an art, is to identify a trend reversal at a relatively early stage and ride on that trend until the weight of the evidence shows or proves that the trend has reversed.”

&amp;#x200B;

* Technical analysis includes a variety of forecasting techniques ... However, academic research on technical analysis is generally limited to techniques that can be expressed in mathematical forms, namely technical trading systems, although some recent studies attempt to test.
* Since Charles H. Dow first introduced the Dow theory in the late 1800s, technical analysis has been extensively used among market participants such as brokers, dealers, fund managers, speculators, and individual investors in the financial industry. 3 Numerous surveys indicate that practitioners attribute a significant role to technical analysis.
* For example, futures fund managers rely heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems (Irwin and Brorsen 1985; Brorsen and Irwin 1987; Billingsley and Chance 1996), and about 30% to 40% of foreign exchange traders around the world believe that technical analysis is the major factor determining exchange rates in the short-run up to six months (e.g., Menkhoff 1997; Cheung and Wong 2000; Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh 2000; Cheung and Chinn 2001).
* In contrast to the views of many practitioners, most academics are skeptical about technical analysis. Rather, they tend to believe that markets are informationally efficient and hence all available information is impounded in current prices (Fama 1970). In efficient markets, therefore, any attempts to make profits by exploiting currently available information are futile.
* Nevertheless, in recent decades rigorous theoretical explanations for the widespread use of technical analysis have been developed based on noisy rational expectation models (Treynor and Ferguson 1985; Brown and Jennings 1989; Grundy and McNichols 1989; Blume, Easley, and O’Hara 1994), behavioral (or feedback) models (De Long et al. 1990a, 1991; Shleifer and Summers 1990), disequilibrium models (Beja and Goldman 1980), herding models (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein 1992), agent-based models (Schmidt 2002), and chaos theory (Clyde and Osler 1997). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Survey Studies**

&amp;#x200B;

* The oldest survey study regarding technical analysis dates back to Stewart (1949), who analyzed the trading behavior of customers of a large Chicago futures commission firm over the 1924-1932 period. The result indicated that in general traders were unsuccessful in their grain futures trading, regardless of their scale and knowledge of the commodity traded
* Amateur speculators were more likely to be long than short in futures markets.
* Smidt (1965a) surveyed trading activities of amateur traders in the US commodity futures markets in 1961.4 In this survey, about 53% of respondents claimed that they used charts either exclusively or moderately in order to identify trends.
* There was a slight tendency for chartists to pyramid more frequently than other traders.5 It is interesting to note that only 10% of the chartists, compared to 29% of the non-chartists, nearly always took long positions.
* The Group of Thirty (1985) surveyed the views of market participants on the functioning of the foreign exchange market in 1985. The respondents were composed of 40 large banks and 15 securities houses in 12 countries.
* 97% of bank respondents and 87% of the securities houses believed that the use of technical analysis had a significant impact on the market.
* Brorsen and Irwin (1987) carried out a survey of large public futures funds’ advisory groups in 1986. In their survey, more than half of the advisors responded that they relied heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems.
* Since technically traded public and private futures funds were estimated to control an average of 23% of the open interest in ten important futures markets, the funds seemed large enough to move prices if they traded in unison ( &lt;&lt; Interesting point)
* Frankel and Froot (1990) showed that switching a forecasting method for another over time may explain changes in the demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets. The evidence provided was the survey results of Euromoney magazine for foreign exchange forecasting firms.
* In 1978, nineteen forecasting firms exclusively used fundamental analysis and only three firms technical analysis. After 1983, however, the distribution had been reversed. In 1983, only one firm reported using fundamental analysis, and eight technical analysis. In 1988, seven firms appeared to rely on fundamental analysis while eighteen firms employed technical analysis.
* Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh (2000) surveyed the views of UK-based foreign exchange dealers on technical anaysis in 1998. In this survey, 33% of the respondents described themselves as technical analysts
* Moreover, 26% of the dealers responded that technical trading is the most important factor that determines exchange rate movements over the medium run.
* Cheung and Chinn (2001) published survey results for US-based foreign exchange traders conducted in 1998. In the survey, about 30% of the traders indicated that technical trading best describes their trading strategy
* About 31% of the traders responded that technical trading was the primary factor determining exchange rate movements up to 6 months.

(Quite a lot more in this survey section but will leave it at that to keep this somewhat brief)

* In sum, survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by practitioners in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and regarded as an important factor in determining price movements at shorter time horizons. However, no survey evidence for stock market traders was found.

&amp;#x200B;

**Theory**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Efficient Markets Hypothesis**

&amp;#x200B;

The efficient markets hypothesis has long been a dominant paradigm in describing the behavior of prices in speculative markets. Working (1949, p. 160) provided an early version of the hypothesis:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If it is possible under any given combination of circumstances to predict future price changes and have the predictions fulfilled, it follows that the market expectations must have been defective ; ideal market expectations would have taken full account of the information which permitted successful prediction of the price changes.

&amp;#x200B;

* Revised his definition of a perfect futures market to “… one in which the market price would constitute at all times the best estimate that could be made, from currently available information, of what the price would be at the delivery date of the futures contracts (Working, 1962, p. 446).”
* Identical to the famous definition of an efficient market given by Fama (1970, p. 383): “A market in which prices always ‘fully reflect’ available information is called ‘efficient’.”
* Thus, technical analysis provides a weak form test of market efficiency because it heavily uses past price history

(I'm going to skip some section now but the full table of content is at the bottom of the post)

&amp;#x200B;

**Chart Pattern Studies**

&amp;#x200B;

* Chang and Osler evaluated the performance of the head-and-shoulders pattern using daily spot rates for 6 currencies (mark, yen, pound, franc, Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar) during the entire floating rate period, 1973-1994.
* head-and-shoulders rule s generated statistically significant returns of about 13% and 19% per year for the mark and yen, respectively, but not for the other exchange rates.
* Returns from the exogenous exit rule appeared to be insignificant in most cases. The trading profits from the endogenous exit rules were substantially higher than either the annual buy-and-hold returns of 2.5% for the mark and 4.4% for the yen or annual average stock yield of 6.8% measured on the S&amp;P 500 index.
* Chang and Osler further investigated the performance of moving average rules and momentum rules and compared the results with the observed performance of the head-and shoulders rule. Returns from the simple technical trading systems appeared statistically significant for all six currencies and the simpler rules easily outperformed the head-and shoulders rules
* Hence, Chang and Osler concluded that, although the head-and-shoulders patterns had some predictive power for the mark and yen during the period of floating exchange rates, the use of the head-and-shoulders rule did not seem to be rational, because they were easily dominated by simple moving average rules and momentum rules (&lt;&lt; This is actually a really good point. The way a trend forms means the head and shoulders pattern produces one of the most common false signals and usually a strong counter move when breaking, but the ones that work are important).
* Caginalp and Laurent (1998) reported that candlestick reversal patterns generated substantial profits in comparison to an average gain for the same holding period. For the S&amp;P 500 stocks over the 1992-1996 period
* In general, the results of chart pattern studies varied depending on patterns, markets, and sample periods tested, but suggested that some chart patterns might have been profitable in stock markets and foreign exchange markets

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary and Conclusion**

* Most survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that at least 30% to 50 40% of practitioners regard technical analysis as an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.
* In the theoretical literature, the conventional efficient markets models, such as the martingale and random walk models, rule out the existence of profitable technical trading (&lt;&lt; All the efficient market stuff is just a theory. It's so often stated as if it is fact)... On the other hand, several other models, such as noisy rational expectations models, feedback models, disequilibrium models, herding models, agent-based models, and chaos theory, suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable
* In these models, thus, there exist profitable trading opportunities that are not being exploited.

30,investing,Should I go 10% Cash or 10% Bonds? Are buying bonds today betting that interest rates go negative?,"I have 45% in an international index fund (excludes US stocks), 30% in SP500, 15% in small/mid cap index. 

I would like to keep 10% in bonds or cash to take advantage of rebalancing. 

But I'm not sure how I feel about bonds right now. If you are buying bonds now, isn't that kind of like betting interest rates will go negative? I know bonds tend to go down in value when interest rates go up. And it seems a common theme now is investors shorting bonds, which is a little scary to be honest. 

The Cash fund offered in my plan is "" Invesco Stable Val Trust CF"", which basically tracks the ""[FTSE 3 Month US T-Bill Index Series""](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/3m-us-tbill). It has a 0.35% expense ratio, which is kind of high for a cash fund imo.

41,investing,Adobe vs Netflix compared (and faang debate),"I picked these to compare since they both run a subscription based model and have similar marketcaps (250 billion or so), and pe (54 or so) As of right now im leaning towards adobe, the reason is because they have few competitors, diverse products range. I believe they have better growth potential thanks to better pricing power and more user growth potential. (us&amp;international growth vs netflix primarily international) higher margins (40% vs 16%), stock buybacks (-1% vs +1% dilution), high switching costs better moat, much better balance sheet for adobe.

On a forward pe, adobe is about 10% more expensive (fwd pe of 44 vs 40) and marketcap wise it is about 25% higher. (adobe makes about 15% more profit) The main benefit for netflix is improving margins over time but I only see net profit margins going to 25% max.

One thing I want to add for adobe has over 100 products with 60% being creative cloud and that alone has 20-30 famous products like photoshop, primer pro, the stuff you know adobe for. document cloud and digital experience no one knows but that segment is growing like crazy whereas netflix makes 99% of revenue from one main product. the two segments for adobe is mostly business to business like digital marketing, digital signatures, data analytics, ai, ecommerce sales, publishing, and much more and makes 40% of sales and growing in a fast market where things are going more digital (think youtube, shopify, docusign). I just dont see much growth for netflix where pretty much in the us more than 70 million users out of 120 million households have it already.

But i put up an poll on whats better earlier elsewhere and everyone said netflix, but no one really explained why? is adobe underrated and should it replace netflix in faang, or is netflix still king and explain why it is better because i dont get the hype and why everyone still use faang for big tech synonym when they are several other growth tech companies like adobe that have much higher marketcap than netflix. anyways, what is your pick on whats the better company",1627709881
64,investing,How to make Money With TikTok (Sorry for long post),"**How to make money with TikTok**

(Before we start, This is how I did all this 100% Free: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr\_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s) 

**The** first manner human beings are creating wealth from Tik Tok is developing bills after which promoting them. This is turning into an increasing number of famous with-inside the eCommerce or product area. Example of Tiktok Live on diverse Tiktok bills. Similar to Instagram, you’re going to pick a gap after which pass in advance and create wonderful content material, preferably content material that is going viral to draw that individual who might be the appropriate client on your product. There are already human beings on this area nowadays who're developing TikTok profiles round a sure hobby.

Usually it’s a gap subject matter and that they may not have whatever to promote, however they’re going to attain out to manufacturers in that enterprise and promote their TikTok profile to them and those are authentic creating wealth this manner. The right information for product manufacturers is after they have that account of their hands, it’s without a doubt pretty clean to promote merchandise. One manner that human beings are promoting merchandise is thru TikTok Live. They are launching merchandise whilst livestreaming or they’re without a doubt keeping auctions whilst stay streaming. And, of course, there may be the hyperlink withinside the bio wherein you may constantly power your fans to buy your product. So in case you’re the kind of individual to like TikTok, and also you simply need to develop a following round a sure subject matter and construct that network round a sure subject matter, pass for it after which attain out to the ones manufacturers who would really like to have get admission to to the ones fans and promote them your account.

**#2: Donations** The 2nd manner human beings are creating wealth from TikTok goes Live and gathering donations from viewers (similar to you may do on different platforms, like Twitch). I discover this selection of TikTok fascinating. It’s truly a constructed in monetization platform, actually from day one. From what I’ve visible, here’s the way it works: When you’re a TikTok user, you may pass into your profile and buy some thing referred to as cash. For one hundred cash it'll price you $1.39. Now what do you do with those cash? When one in every of your preferred creators goes Live, you may without a doubt ship them cash as a manner of giving thank you for all in their attempt in growing the content material they do. What does the author do with this coin? The author turns the cash into diamonds and people diamonds may be transformed into coins through PayPal. Cool, proper? On the Chinese model of TikTok – an app referred to as Douyin – there may be a next-stage function much like this. When creators are Live, they could without a doubt connect a buying cart to a product they promote. So it’s kinda like QVC or the buying channel. You can pass Live, keep an auction, and those can purchase your product whilst you’re Live thru the buying cart function. My bet is this selection goes to return back to bills international faster in preference to later.

**#3: Manage** influencer campaigns The 1/3 manner to make cash from TikTok is to control influencer campaigns. This isn’t a brand new idea. There are directly up influencer organizations to serve Instagram influencers already. The identical idea applies to TikTok. You may be the intermediary or the broking among a author on TikTok and a logo who desires to paintings with that influencer. From growing the settlement, coping with each parties, ensuring the deliverables are all met – simply being a coordinator – you may fee a carrier rate to control campaigns like that. TikTok as a platform is smart; they without a doubt have an inner influencer software already constructed in. So if I’m a massive logo and I need to attain out to TikTok and say, Hey, that is the distance I’m in, what influencers ought to I paintings with? I can do that. The best component is, I’m going to pay a percent to TikTok for brokering that settlement. That’s wherein you may are available in as a carrier or business enterprise to make that settlement outdoor of TikTok and assist manufacturers shop a bit little bit of cash

**#4: Tiktok** advertisements platform The fourth manner you may make cash from TikTok is through the use of their advertisements platform. Just like Facebook and Instagram advertisements, you may Google proper now, “TikTok advertisements” and join up for get admission to to their advertisements platform. It is quite self-explanatory in case you’ve ever run paid site visitors before, so in case your market’s on TikTok, it is probably really well worth you growing some advertisements, placing a few price range closer to experimenting there and seeing what occurs. Maybe you may promote greater of your merchandise thru TikTok!

**#5: Management offerings** The 5th manner you may make cash from TikTok is through presenting control offerings for creators at the app. Some creators on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of fans and occasionally this occurs truly rapid and in a single day for that author. It’s like having a enterprise land of their lap. Tiktok profile of Charli D'Amelio with 14.4M fans. You should step in and provide offerings to assist them with their content material method, their innovative method, perhaps coping with gives and offers that come their manner. So when you have that history in manufacturing or storytelling, you may simply observe that to presenting control offerings to [TikTok creators.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)

**#6: Consulting** Last however now no longer least, when you turn out to be a seasoned on TikTok, and perhaps you truly apprehend how a person should take a video that perhaps receives one hundred perspectives and assist them get 100,000 perspectives, well, you may really provide consulting offerings. This is a truly high-quality manner to leverage your understanding from the platform and assist folks who need to be TikTok well-known or they need to be creators, without a doubt increase their method so their films get visible through loads of thousands, if now no longer hundreds of thousands of human beings.

Of course, you want to have the history and the enjoy on this first to provide this as a carrier. But when you’re there, human beings can pay to have your enjoy and your mind on their account. And in case you assist them get any offers or influencer agreements, you may even negotiate a percent or a reduce of that deal really due to the fact you're their representative and you've helped them pass viral on TikTok. So there you've got got it. Six approaches that I see human beings creating wealth from[ TikTok nowadays, even whilst it’s ](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)nevertheless truly, truly early on. Let’s pass returned to my first factor at the start of this video. Why do I, an Instagram marketer, suppose that TikTok is probably greater effective than Instagram? The manner I see it, Instagram testimonies are type of much like TikTok films, however they expire after 24 hours. This is wherein TikTok is effective. TikTok is without a doubt much like YouTube, which means you may submit a video nowadays, however perhaps the set of rules alternatives it up months later and begins offevolved pushing that video into the feed of folks who would really like it.

The reality that your films don’t disappear has a variety of electricity to it due to the fact it could power a variety of site visitors and eyeballs to you months after the reality. That motive on my own is why human beings have become occasionally hundreds of thousands of perspectives to their TikTok films with only a few fans. It’s due to the fact the set of rules is selecting up your video, and pushing it out. Again, there’s a variety of hobby and now no longer a variety of content material. So the set of rules is pushing it out to the folks who it thinks are going to be receptive to that content material. And – hello – waking as much as hundreds of thousands of perspectives with only a few fans. I mean, in nowadays’s day and age, I don’t suppose there’s some other app or platform that could provide you with the ones types of[ outcomes proper now.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)",1627691066

I compiled my two year job history W2 and tax returns and I’m a bit concerned about 2019. I was in between jobs and did a lot of contract/short term rules but sometimes had times where I was not working. my 2019 tax returns is maybe half of what I made in 2020.

82,investing,Is valuation relative or absolute?,"Something I've been struggling with over the past 5 years or so is whether my perception of valuations should be strictly relative, or at least to a degree, absolute. As Howard Marks says in [this video](https://youtu.be/Dal2ecPcE0g), no asset class valuation is explicitly irrational right now relative to interest rates and other assets, and so in that sense we are not in a traditional bubble. That said, I feel like some assets may be in a bubble not because of their relative valuation, but rather because of the safety that investors generally associate with them and the potential downside risk.

For example, treasuries are meant to be a ""safe haven"", but if you consider the damage that a 1% increase to long-term rates could do to 20 or 30yr treasuries, they are actually not a safe haven at all with regard to preservation of capital in the medium term. As another example, forward P/E typically tops out around 16x or maybe 18x on the very very high end of norms. Analyst estimates have SP 500 2022 earnings at about 215 which means that if the forward P/E ratio returns back to somewhere the very very high end of near normal by year end, the SP 500 would be at 3870 which is a 12% correction from where we are. When weighing whether we'll still be at either 18x or 22x forward P/E, or whether earnings will somehow beat estimates by a lot, it still seems like there is outsized downside risk in buying the SP 500 at 4400 in July 2021. It just doesn't seem rational.

TLDR; even though valuations are relatively fair, are they too high relative to the downside risk? Owning treasuries and even stocks seems to be like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.",1627671199

94,investing,Wash sale tax question specific to ETrade,"I've hit the limits on google, so would like to hear others opinions. I stumbled across this article recently: [Strategies to Help Clients Around the Wash Sale Rule | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strategies-help-clients-around-wash-sale-rule-2015-11-10)

TL;DR: within the article is an interesting strategy to capture a loss on common without triggering a wash sale. 1) Sell your stock at a loss 2) buy a long call (triggers wash sale, inherits the basis) 3) Buy back the stock (has its own basis).

I called up ETrade to confirm they would assign the cost basis to the call, however several ETrade customer service reps told me that ETrade does not consider long or short calls to trigger the wash sale (even if the call is ITM). This seems at odds with various interpretations of the murky IRS guidelines on wash sales. At the end of the day, I will report whatever is in my 1099, but this seems wrong given a call (even OTM) is often considered ""substantially identical.""

According to ETrade, I should be able to do the following: 1) sell stock at a loss 2) buy a 30 day OTM call to capture any potential upside (no wash sale adjustment) 3) wait 31 days from step 1 and then buy back the stock (avoiding wash sale).

Anyone have direct experience with either approach above and received 1099s from ETrade that can clear this up for me? Would it be safer to do a different strategy (also outlined in the article): 1) sell the stock 2) sell a 31-day ITM put to lock in a purchase price?",1627666207

Mainstream social media users (could be your son/friend/whoever) sign up, buy token X inside the app and bid with it for those OG Jordans = thus generate demand for the token itself. The more people take part in auctions, the bigger the price of the token (price volatility is considered as a fun factor here).

6,investing,Bundle Dao - Advanced Smart Crypto Indices,"  

Hello all, just want to help the community at large out with spreading some knowledge on a innovative new investment product, smart indices on BSC brought to you by Bundle Dao.

The indices currently available to mint or to purchase from the free market are bDeFi (a collection of blue-chip DeFi tokens), bChain (a hyper-focused index containing native assets of market-leading chains and high-cap protocols), and my personal favorite bStable (a collection of your major stable coins). Think of these as basically being able to own and track specific segments of the crypto market in one token. One coin for a piece of the whole pie. What makes these indices unique in the world of crypto is the ability for dynamic re balancing and arbitraging boosting gains inside the index. On top of this, future updates will bring strategies to the indices, meaning they will become passive income earning machines. The indexes can be easily minted from the requisite assets or purchased from the open market via PCS. These indices can then be staked on the Bundle platform to earn additional yield in the form of the protocol's native token BDL, a hard capped at 210,000,000 governance and profit sharing token, earning holders a portion of the protocol's performance fees.

In short this is the real deal. No boring ass copy pasta PCS and Goose clones, no broken algo, and the only project doing anything similar isn't doing it even nearly to this level and is basically a shit farm token. The dev on this project is a mad genius and community on Discord is about as helpful as they come. The upside on this shit is huge. DYOR. Check it out. Links and stats below.

23,investing,An Insight Into Canadian Casino Stocks," 

Six out of ten Canadians partake in monthly gambling of some form placing Canada fourth on the list of countries spending the most in the sector. At the time of writing there are 88 land-based casinos in Canada, and citizens are at liberty to gamble at a number of offshore online casinos that accept Canadian players.

The law surrounding online casinos in Canada is not as straightforward as in some other countries. Legally, casinos cannot operate if the servers are located on Canadian soil but offshore sites based in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus accept Canadian players.

Furthermore, the native territory of Kahnawake has their own Gaming Commission that licenses both online and land-based casinos. Spin casino is an example of a provider with licenses from both Malta and Kahnawake. The online casino is regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority, a worldwide established gaming license company.

The combination of a disposed general public and sufficient regulatory space has and will continue to have a positive effect on Canadian casino stocks. The best performing Canadian gaming/gambling stocks at present are:

* Pollard Banknote Limited (PBL)

A printing company for government lotteries in North America and the rest of the world. With a market cap of $1.38 billion CAD and a 43.82% price change increase in the year to date, PBL is a solid investment.

* Great Canadian Gaming Corporation (GC)

Operating 25 facilities across the country including casinos, hotels and theatres GC Gaming is one of the largest gaming companies in the province. Based out of British Columbia, they now possess a market cap of $2.56 billion CAD and with a recent takeover bid by Apollo Global Management Inc. given the green light there is an element of uncertainty (and potential to make profit) in the near future.

* Gamehost Inc. (GH)

A much smaller market cap of only $188 million CAD compared to GC Gaming, Gamehost is Alberta’s hospitality and gaming leader, operating slot machines, lottery terminals and table games at their facilities. Riskier than more established options in an already volatile sector, the investment has the potential to go either way.

Recently, bill C-218 passed in the Senate which will signal the legalization of single-event sport gambling. The upper chamber approved the bill in June 2021 and will become law once royal assent is approved.

The adoption of this landmark act will expand the betting and gaming industry hugely as well as generating billions in revenue for Provincial governments that regulate gambling. It will mean the money that was once spent on offshore sites will now be able to be regulated on home turf and the domestic stock market is likely to respond accordingly.

The gaming sector for the longest time has been a steady up and up investment. However, recently some dyed in the wool stalwarts have been not only underperforming but even losing value. Burgeoning companies adopting new technologies can be undervalued and while carrying a touch more risk might pay attractive dividends. Either that or pick out the well-established companies that have their sights set expanding their operations.

Comparing MSFT's growth rate, P/S and P/E to Google's and Facebooks, I can't help but notice both Google and Facebook have significantly higher sales growth and lower P/E's and P/S's.

MSFT has a strong position in cloud, desktop/laptop OS and business/educational software, but in terms of long-term growth with growing markets like tablets, AI, and advertising, is MSFT a player in those or other new growth markets?

17,investing,Investing in Wine for the enthusiast,"Someone had previously asked about investing in wine, and the explanations didn't really reach deeper. I became particularly curious and have made it this deep so far on how an enthusiast might better invest in wine. We can start with some basic parts.

1. Obtaining investment grade wines (typically called Growths and from regions in France though I found a Lebanese wine, *Chateau Musar*, that has some great appeal.
2. Storing - [winebid.com](https://winebid.com) seems superior (was recommended to me) to [vinfolio.com](https://vinfolio.com) \- the differences being [winebid.com](https://winebid.com) has a more thorough process of inspection before auction and so is probably more likely to move better wines. Winebid requires your collection be stored with them until auction. Vinfolio apparently does not require this.
3. Selling - What investment wine and why? How do the prices move? You can determine that decently here: [https://www.wineauctionprices.com/](https://www.wineauctionprices.com/)

I'm not entirely sold on the idea of buying a wine as investment to flip it. The value-added (*already priced in*) to purchasing a wine at some investment storage facility means the only potential value of your wine investment would have to come from price appreciation at the wholesale.

Rather, the best way to invest in wine continues to seem to be the importer, the direct buyer, and the retail-seller.

For the scopes of many, I think retail is far off. It'd require some reason for someone to buy wine from you at retail prices, such as at a restaurant.

If you are to invest in wine then, I think #1 from above means you'll have to do your homework and actually buy these wines direct. And I haven't determined yet how competitive that is but rest assured there's plenty of wine consultants who already do it in order to acquire a library of bottles for distribution to their clientele such as restaurants.

But, if you can do the same and accumulate a library of bottles from the wineries themselves (they also compete by selling wholesale on these sites and online sales), then you get yourself a nice mark-up premium and you can continue to enjoy price appreciation as well.",1627575874

These analysts work for firms that hold these stocks don’t they? So what would be their incentive to have a stock under perform analyst expectations? Surely they are incentivised to issue estimates that are going to be beaten and cause the earnings to seem great? 

How else is it possible that almost every earnings announcement from big tech firms come in above the average analyst expectations?

Prosecutors charged the billionaire, who resigned as chairman in September, with two counts of securities fraud, including making false statements about the company, and wire fraud.

“Milton’s scheme targeted individual, non-professional investors — so-called retail investors — by making false and misleading statements directly to the investing public through social media, and television, print and podcast interviews,” prosecutors said in the 49-page indictment. 

Milton, who was the company’s largest shareholder, was held roughly $8.5 billion in Nikola stock at the height of the company’s value.

Shares of Nikola were down by more than 9% during premarket trading to less than $13 a share.

The grand jury said Milton shall forfeit all property “traceable to the commission of said offenses,” which would likely include the more than $1 billion he earned when Nikola went public in June 2020.

Prosecutors said Milton “was motivated to engage in the fraudulent scheme in order to enrich himself and elevate his stature as an entrepreneur.”

2. Cupridyne Clean Consumer- Media push coming
3. AOS- best known micro pollutants killer - after years of development finally in commercial trials
4. Cupridyne Clean - potential wide adoption (ODIN / Cannabusters)
5. Minerals extraction - in hard negotiations- Being a project manager, small partner, engineer, and building out the pilot facility of a $1 billion+ project sounds pretty lucrative
6. Successful Clyra Medical Product launch
7. EPA list N inclusion for Cupridyne/Clyra products
8. Garratt Callahan partnership- product they bring to market. ($3-4 Million early revenue expected)
9. Other Blest Projects. (Signed $1.2 Million in contracts within 10 days)

**The Bull thesis**

Commercialization is in full swing; revenues growing and debt paid off and at least one of those above mentioned endeavors will become a big success. More than one and we will do amazingly well - but it is actually looking good that a lot of not all will become a success = a potential Clean Tech Jackpot.

**The Bear thesis**

BioLargo has been a company operating for more than a decade and they spent way too long in R&amp;D without being able to significantly monetize their developments. As a “logical” consequence they will never be able to monetize anything and not a single one of the above will succeed.

**OP.**

It is very obvious that some folks got disappointed because they bought in BioLargo very early and missed buying back on the lows or averaging down.

So if you would hear about a  company that Besides many other promising endeavors - has solutions for two of the massive global water problems and a Billions of dollars bill just passed that is going to invest into clean water in the USA and the entire company is worth just around $50 Million- what would you think?

Right, It sounds too good to be true.

But folks it is not. We have been following BioLargo closely, and what they set out to do is actually happening (with some delays). There is no debt and progress is happening on all fronts.

It’s unheard of to have a purposeful company with that many promising endeavors at a price like this.

IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks.

Speculation of delisting of existing companies was ripe. But I guess China doesn't really want to kill their tech going IPO here as long as they follow all the rules that the govt lays down on them**

China will continue to allow Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. as long as they meet listing requirements, China’s securities regulator told brokerages late Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.

A series of regulatory actions in the last few weeks has heightened investor concerns that Beijing is trying to block foreign capital flows into Chinese assets.

The cross-border stock listings can also occur using the variable interest entity structure, the source said, citing the regulator. It refers to a legal structure which allows international investors to access shares of Chinese companies in the U.S.

The regulator recognized the structure is a vital way for companies to attract foreign capital, but said it would have to be adjusted if there were national security concerns, said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai held a virtual meeting with major investment banks on Wednesday, the source said. It followed days of sharp selling in Chinese stocks on fears of increased regulatory crackdown by Beijing.

Bloomberg first reported news of the meeting.

Chinese stocks listed in Asia and the U.S. — including big names like Alibaba and Tencent — plunged in the last several days as Chinese authorities increased scrutiny on tech companies over monopolistic practices and data security.

A policy document that began circulating widely Friday called for Chinese after-school tutoring companies to become non-profits, sending the stocks plunging by double-digits in Hong Kong and the U.S.

The policy specifically banned tutoring companies from raising money through the stock market or having foreign investors, particularly through the variable interest entity legal structure that allows international investors to access Chinese shares.

The speed and breadth of the policy surprised many. Goldman Sachs on Monday downgraded Chinese education stocks on expectations the after-school tutoring market would “shrink significantly” — to less than one-fourth its current $106 billion size.

However, the securities commission’s Fang said the policy was intended to reduce the burden on parents — not shut off foreign investment — and the education companies will have as much time as needed to restructure, according to the source.

The securities regulator did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

85,investing,Uber shares drop as Softbank plans to sell shares to cover Didi losses,"SoftBank is selling about one-third of its stake in ride-hailing company Uber to cover losses on its investment in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. It’s planning to sell 45 million shares, which will have a 30-day lockup.

Uber shares fell 5% in extended trading following the report.

The value of Uber’s own Didi stake declined $2 billion last week following the June debut of Didi’s American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange, as China reportedly planned fines and other punishments against the company amidst a broader crackdown on U.S. listed Chinese companies.

SoftBank has lost about $4 billion on its Didi position in total, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa reported.

The news comes one week after Uber stock rose slightly after the company’s trucking unit announced plans to acquire shipping software company Transplace from TPG Capital for around $2.25 billion.

Didi shares have fallen 37% from their $14.14 closing price on their first day of trading, June 30. Over the same period Uber shares are down about 8%.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/uber-shares-drop-as-softbank-plans-to-sell-shares-to-cover-didi-losses.html

*The weird part is, why are they covering right now? Are they anticipating that the fine on DIDI by the regulatory board in China would decimate their DIDI stake a lot? They have been in Uber for a long time and I still don't know why they need to cover those losses right now.*",1627511852

97,investing,Bear Theory on AMD valuation,"Here's my bear theory on AMD:

AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage.

Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters.

AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips.

[https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)

I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Therefore AMD is at **SIGNIFICANT RISK** to geopolitics.

They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

1,investing,Centralized exchanges are costing us our portfolios! This is why investors are running towards decentralized trading platforms!,"Honestly, I am sick of their bulls\*\*t. Centralized exchanges have never been safe enough, they will always be holding control on out assets, and I do not think anyone forgot about the Robinhood and GameStop incident, or the Thodex case. 

The main alternative for platforms like these is actually decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges are financial platforms that allow their users to convert their digital assets, with the transactions getting recorded on the blockchain. And here is the main difference between the two options, investing in DEX guarantees you the right to retain control over your funds. 

Another guarantee for investors’ safety is the KYC policies followed by decentralized exchanges. Investors’ privacy is extremely violated when it comes to CEX, they are required to upload pictures with an ID verification and etc… meanwhile trading on DEX only requires a wallet connection, now which is a safer platform do you think?

The trading volumes on decentralized exchanges are growing constantly, which is why we are witnessing a high number of platforms, like UniSwap, PancakeSwap, and Merrymen, who are willing to offer 10% of their tokens for all those who were harmed in the Robinhood – GameStop fiasco.

What do you think is the most important difference between these two models? And which platform do you prefer?",1627501181
3,investing,Blackrock has plenty of upside and a good dividend,"**Valuation: Undervalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· Blackrock has solidified themselves as one of the biggest investment managers/firms in the world, and their ability to have consistent growth is unparalleled.

o If you are looking for something that is safe and generally follows market trends, Blackrock is just the stock for you. Furthermore, with a dividend of 1.9% (which is also growing quickly) Blackrock could be one of the best dividend growth stocks around.

· Based off of the valuation techniques used in this analysis, I concluded that Blackrock should be valued at $1010/share, which implies an upside of 16%.

o However, with every investment there are risks/catalysts that cannot be forecasted, some of these are listed at the bottom of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$BLK Stock - Blackrock Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/BLK) is an investment management firm with over $8T worth of assets under their management. Blackrock offers single and multi-asset portfolios that consist of equities, fixed incomes, and other financial instruments to their institutional and retail (individual) clients worldwide.

**Investment Information:**

Assets Under Management (AUM):

As previously mentioned, Blackrock has over $8T in assets under their management ($8.68T to be exact). What is more impressive than this level of AUM is their growth rate in their AUM. Over the past 5 years, Blackrock has averaged a 5-year CAGR of their AUM of 13%.

This is very important because a company like Blackrock ‘s investment management fees are earned as a percentage of their AUM. So, the larger their AUM, the more revenues they report in their financials, the higher their stock price.

iShares:

I guarantee that if you have ever looked for ETF to invest in that you have come across one of iShares ETF’s. Blackrock is actually the parent company of iShares, now you might be wondering why I am bringing this up and why it matters.

As of December 31st, 2020, Blackrock had $2.67T of their AUM in iShares ETF’s.

In total, iShares has 386 different ETFs with an average expense ratio of 0.31%.

When we do the math, iShares (owned by Blackrock) made $8.27B just off of the fees involved with owning their ETF’s last year from Blackrock’s clients alone.

This is very important because they are “double-dipping”. By this I mean that Blackrock is charging their own management fees, and then investing that money into a product (iShares ETF) that makes them an additional fee (on top of their original management fee).

Financial Information:

· Financial Performance (Good): In 2020, Blackrock was able to increase their total revenue 11%, their operating income by 3%, their net income by 10%, and their Assets Under Management (AUM) by 16.8%.

· Financial Performance (Bad): In 2020, Blackrock’s cost of revenue (total expenses) grew by 17%. The fact that Blackrock’s cost of revenues grew faster than their revenues is not good and contributes to a lower operating margin. This is seen in the decrease in their operating margin from 2019 (38%) to 2020 (35%).

· Dilution: In 2020, Blackrock only had one stream of share dilution which came from their convertible preferred shares. In 2020, there were 823,188 common shares that were issued due to the conversion of Blackrock’s Series B convertible shares. This share issuance had a dilutionary effect on Blackrock’s existing common shares of 0.5%. Overall, this 0.5% dilution is really nothing to stress over as an investor or potential investor in Blackrock.

*Valuation Information:*

WACC:

Through my own WACC model, I found Blackrock’s WACC to be 7.36%, which I used in my DCF model.

CAGR (2021-2026):

I found the average analysts revenue growth projection over the next 5 years to be a CAGR of 13.4%. I used this growth rate in the specified years. This makes sense and is closely related to Blackrock’s AUM growth rate.

CAGR (2026+):

I estimated Blackrock’s CAGR after 2026 to be 7%, I see this growth rate as reasonable therefore I decided to use it.

Operating Expense Increase Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock’s operating expenses have grown at an average of 7.87% every year. I decided to use this same growth rate moving forward.

Interest Expense Increase Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has experienced an interest expense growth of 5.33% per year. I decided to use this 5.33% growth rate to forecast Blackrock’s future interest expense growth.

Depreciation &amp; Amortization Decrease Rate:

Over the past couple of years, BlackRock has been able to consistently decrease their depreciation/amortization figures despite having increases in their revenues/profits. Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has been able to decrease this figure at a rate of 14.26%, which I used to forecast future decreases.

Tax Rate:

I was able to find Blackrock’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 to be 20.1%. I was able to find this through their SEC 10-K filing. I used this tax rate throughout my model.

CAPEX Decrease Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has been able to decrease their capital expenditures by an average of 2.5%/year. I used this to forecast future decreases in their CAPEX.

Risk Free Rate:

I was able to find Blackrock’s risk-free rate through a website called Finbox, who estimated it to be 2.25%

**Investment Valuation:**

DCF:

In order to value Blackrock’s stock ($BLK), I decided to undergo a DCF model. In order to complete this model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. My DCF model estimates the fair price of Blackrock to be $1,103/share, which would imply an upside of 26%. However, this estimate seems a little bit high, so I decided to do some comparable analyses to either support or disprove the DCF valuation.

Comparable Analyses:

P/B:

I compared Blackrock’s P/B ratio to their competitors (listed above in the “competitor information” section of this report). I did this because it is very common to value finance and financial services businesses through their P/B ratio since they have a lot of assets in their book value. By doing this I arrived at a fair price of Blackrock of $1130/share which implies an upside of 29%.

P/E:

By comparing Blackrock’s P/E ratio to that of their competition, I found that Blackrock’s fair value should be around $799/share, which would imply a downside risk of 8.5%.

EV/EBITDA:

By comparing Blackrock’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Blackrock’s fair value to be $641/share, which would imply a downside risk to this investment of 27%. As you have probably noticed, these valuations vary a lot and as a result of this I decided to take a weighted average of these 3 results to boil it down to one comparable valuation.

Weighted Average Comparable:

To carry out this comparable, I weighed the P/B valuation to be 50%, and the P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios to be split equally, each being weighted as 25%. I chose this split due to the importance of the P/B ratio when valuing financial businesses. By doing this, I arrived at a comparable analysis valuation of $925/share, which implies that Blackrock is undervalued by 6%.

Dividend Discount Model:

I was not able to undergo a dividend discount model due to the growth rate of Backstone’s dividends compared to their WACC.

This is both good and bad. Firstly, it is good for investors as they can expect Blackrock’s dividend to keep growing with their stock in the future. However, it is bad for me because I cannot use this model to further validate/invalidate my valuation.

**Plan:**

Buying Blackrock under $900/share helps to limit the downside risk of this investment, while still guaranteeing a good return.

Therefore, I see buying Blackrock under $900 as a good buy.

I would then look to sell a position around the $1010/share mark.

If you were to enter at current prices ($873) and sell for $1010/share, there would be a total upside to this investment of 16%.

**Risks:**

· Financial Performance: If Blackrock has a bad financial performance, it might spook both their clients and investors, which could have adverse effects on their share price. Additionally, if Blackrock is not able to meet their expected growth targets, some investors may sell off due to their valuation.

· Market Conditions: By nature, Blackrock will perform poorly under poor market condition. This is kind of the same for every stock, however more so for Blackrock as they are an investment firm.

**Catalysts:**

· Financial Performance: There really is not too many catalysts for companies like Blackrock other than their financial performance. This sis largely due to the fact that their business is based on good financial performances both for themselves and for their clients. If Blackrock is able to continue their good financial performances and continue to grow at the rate, they currently they will do just fine.

4,investing,My $LULU Price Target Deems them to be Undervalued,"**Valuation: Overvalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· Lululemon represents a great investment opportunity as they continue their expansion into Asia, Europe, and China.

o If done successfully, this can help Lululemon launch their business to the next level, and drastically improve on their financial reports.

· Furthermore, Lululemon’s desire to grow is also exhibited through their acquisition of MIRROR, which they believe is an extension of their brands principals/image.

o If Lululemon can make changes to this business and scale it, there is another fantastic opportunity for future growth there.

· However, the valuation techniques used in this report argue that Lululemon’s Stock - $LULU, is currently overvalued. My models predict that $LULU price target is $362/share (implying a 9.4% drop).

o There are risks and catalysts that could potentially have large impacts on the share price, and my opinions on them as a company. These risks/catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$LULU – Lululemon Athletica Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/LULU) designs and distributes their athletic apparel, and accessories to their customers worldwide. Lululemon’s goal is to continue to grow their cult-like following around the principals of exercise and health.

Lululemon is actively chasing this goal, which Is evident through their recent purchase of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform with live &amp; pre-recorded classes.

Recently, Lululemon has set their eyes on further expansion into China, Europe, and Asia, which could be very lucrative if done correctly, as these countries/continents have large markets.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

Lululemon has split their business into 2 main segments in their sec filings for reporting purposes. These two segments include their Company-Operated Stores, and their Direct-to-Consumer segment (DTC).

In 2020, their DTC segment represented 52% of their total revenues. This increased drastically from 2019, as in 2019 only 29% of Lululemon’s revenue came from their DTC sales channel. This increase is good to see as an investor as the DTC sales model tends to have better margins, which can help Lululemon’s profitability and help them report better financials.

In 2020, Lululemon’s Company-Operated segment represented 38% of their total revenues. This is a large decrease from their 2019 figure of 63%. Once again this is good to see as DTC tends to be favourable for companies.

This drastic shift away from Company-Operated stores, and to their DTC sales channel can be attributed to COVID-19. Many companies (including Lululemon) were forced to close their stores at the start of the pandemic, these companies were forced to either adapt or be left behind. Luckily for Lululemon, they already had an established DTC model, which helped them to adapt quickly and capture the online market very quickly. As a result of this, Lululemon was able to generate record revenues and increase their margins.

The rest of the revenues not accounted for belong to their “other” segment. This “other” segment includes their revenues from MIRROR, outlet stores, and pop-up stores.

*Company-Operated Stores:*

Despite the pandemic still raging on Lululemon was able to net an increase of 30 stores in 2020. Out of these 30 stores, 10 came from the USA, 17 came from China, 2 came from the UK, 2 came from South Korea, and 1 came from Germany.

If you did the math, you will have noticed that I just listed off 32 new stores, this is because I have not factored in the 2 stores that were closed down over the past year, 1 store in Canada closed, and 1 store in Japan closed.

As we can see from their Company-Operated Stores data, Lululemon is currently expanding into Europe and China. It is likely that we see this expansion continue in China and Europe, as well as a focus on starting to expand into Asia.

*Seasonality:*

Lululemon has acknowledged that their revenues are very seasonal, and that they tend to generate the most revenue in the fourth quarter. This is very common among multiple industries (especially retail) as it is the holiday season. However, Lululemon’s business is much more seasonal than most. This can be observed through their revenues in 2019 and 2020, in which $LULU earnings reported that 47% and 56% of their revenues in these respective years came in the fourth quarter alone.

This is important to know as an investor and is noteworthy especially as we approach $LULU stock earnings for Q4 (likely to be on January 31st, 2022). This jump in revenues is already somewhat priced in, however if we assume that 56% of their revenues comes in Q4 this year than we ca make our own estimate.

Using this 56% figure, we can estimate Lululemon’s Q4 EPS to be $2.74 \[(sum of Q1-Q3)/ (0.44)\] – (Sum of Q1-Q3). This implies that Lululemon will beat their earnings report in Q4 by 10.93% (Q4 EPS estimated to be $2.47 by taking the average of 8 analyst estimates) which may serve to be a catalyst in the future.

*MIRROR Acquisition:*

On July 7th, 2020, Lululemon purchased all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with both live and on-demand classes. It has been reported that this purchase was $500M. Of this $500M, Lululemon has reported that $360M of it is “goodwill”.

For those of you that do not know, “goodwill” is the difference between the purchase price of a business, and that businesses fair value of assets \[= (assets acquired) – (liabilities assumed)\]. In this case, Lululemon paid $350M over the “fair value” of MIRROR, this goodwill is valuable due to the reputation and the brand that the purchased company built.

In their SEC 10-K filing, Lululemon stated that they purchased MIRROR based off of growth, discount, and royalty rates that they believe the can make in the future. This is important as Lululemon believes that they can generate revenues and profits in the future.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Lululemon was able to increase their revenues by 11%, increase their gross profit by 11%, increase their gross margin by 0.1 percentage point, and increase their DTC revenues by 101%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Lululemon increased their cost of revenue by 10% (which is good because the increase in cost of revenue is less than the increase in revenues), their income from operations decreased by 8% (decreased operating margin), their revenues from company-operated stores fell by 34%, and their net income fell by 9%.

· **Overall Financial Performance:** It is rather difficult to give an opinion on whether Lululemon’s financial performance was good or bad in 2020. This is because there were economic factors (ie. COVID-19) that had adverse effects on businesses, which made some companies report “bad” earnings. However, the pandemic also helped many companies transform to digital, or helped companies (ie. Zoom) to have quicker adoption and report very good earnings. This dilemma is very prevalent with Lululemon as many retail and mall stores did horribly through COVID (Lululemon was no exception), however companies that adopted a social media presence and a DTC model were able to perform rather well (ie. Lululemon). Overall, I think that Lululemon had a slightly worse financial performance (as opposed to better). I think this because their DTC model should have helped them to achieve better margins and be more profitable, however the opposite happened and Lululemon’s net income fell.

· **Options Exercised:** In 2020, Lululemon issued 182,000 shares through the exercise of stock options. This issuance had a dilutionary effect of around 0.1%

· **Performance Stock units (PSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon offered 171,000 shares through the vesting of performance-based stock units (PRU’s). These shares are given out to employees based on their performances and goals that they met. The issuance of these shares had a dilutionary effect on Lululemon’s existing common shares of approximately 0.1%

· **Restricted Stock (and shares) Units (RSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon issued a total of 196,000 common shares as a result of the vesting of their Restricted Stock Units. This issuance had a dilutionary effect on existing shares of approximately 0.2%

· **Share Repurchases:** in 2020, Lululemon reported that they repurchased a total of 400,000 shares in 2020 alone. This repurchase offset the majority of Lululemon’s dilution for the year 2020, netting a total of 149,000 shares issued during the year. This brings the total dilution for 2020 down to 0.1%, which is essentially negligible. The fact that Lululemon has little to no share dilution even after acquiring MIRROR is a very good sign for investors and potential investors alike.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses, I needed to find 4 companies that are comparable/similar to Lululemon.

These companies need to exhibit the following characteristics to be considered: be publicly listed, have valid financial ratios/multiples, have similar operations to Lululemon, and be of similar market cap.

By narrowing down the companies based off of the above criteria, I ended up with the following 4 comparable companies:

· [**$GOOS Stock – Canada Goose Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/GOOS) Canada Goose designs, manufactures, and sells their performance and luxury apparel for men and women. Canada Goose sells their products primarily in Canada but also in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Internationally. Canada Goose also sells their apparel in both physical retail stores as well as through their online store (DTC model).

· [**$LEVI Stock – Levi Strauss &amp; Co**](https://utradea.com/stocks/LEVI)**:** Levi Strauss designs, markets, and sells their jeans, shirts, other forms of apparel, and accessories in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Levi’s sells through 3rd party retailers, 3rd party e-Commerce stores, company-operated stores, and their company website (DTC).

· [**$UA Stock – Under Armour Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UA) Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes their apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. Under Armour sells their products through wholesale channels, distributors, and through their DTC channel (e-Commerce store).

· [**$AEO – American Eagle Outfitters Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/AEO) American Eagle is a specialty retailer that provides clothing and accessories to their customers in USA, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, American Eagle is able to ship to 81 countries around the world through their online store (DTC).

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to calculate the WACC through my own models. These models can be found in the DCF model. My WACC model estimated that Lululemon’s WACC is approximately 7.75%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I used a CAGR that was between Lululemon’s gross profit growth rate over the past 5 years, and the average forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 19.26% over the next 5 years.

*CAGR (2029+):*

I estimated lululemon’s CAGR for 2029 and 2030 to be 10 as it seems like a reasonable number given Lululemon’s growth. In the years between 2025 and 2029, I slowly tapered down the growth rate from 19.26% to 10%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2021-2025):*

In order to achieve this figure, I used the same approach as the CAGR. By doing this I arrived t an Operating Expense Increase Rate of 19%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2029+):*

To predict Lululemon’s operating expense growth rate for 2029 and beyond, I decided to use 9%. I did this because the operating expense increase rate has always been relatively close to their CAGR.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past couple of years, Lululemon’s average yearly Depreciation and Amortization growth is 15.47%. I used this historic growth rate to forecast the future growth in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s tax rate to be 28.10% through their SEC 10-K filings.

*Capital Expenditure Growth Rate:*

Over the past couple of years Lululemon’s CAPEX has grown at an average of 2.2% per year. I used this historic rate to forecast their future growth rate.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s risk free rate through a website called Finbox. Finbox estimated that Lululemon’s risk free rate was 2.25%.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

In order to arrive at a $LULU stock price target, I decided to undergo a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In order to compete my DCF model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By doing this, I found Lululemon’s fair value to be $459/share, which implies an upside of 15%. This is quite reasonable; however, it may be a little high and as a result of this I decided to undergo 3 comparable analyses to gather more information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/EBITDA:*

Through comparing Lululemon’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report), I found that $LULU stock price target should be $311/share. If this were the case, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 22%. This is vastly different from the results achieved through the DCF model, so I underwent another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Lululemon’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that Lululemon should have a fair value around $160/share. If this were to come to fruition, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 60%. This is vastly different from the DCF valuation and is even very different from the previous comparable. As a result of this inconsistency, I decided to undergo one final comparable.

*P/E:*

By comparing Lululemon’s P/E ratio to their public competitors, I found them to have a fair value of $324/share, which would imply a downside risk of 19%. This result is somewhat consistent of that achieved through the EV/EBITDA comparable, however as a result of the general inconsistency among comparable analyses, I decided to take the average result from each of them.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses, I arrived at one, all-encompassing comparable valuation of $265/share, which implies a downside risk of 34%

**Plan:**

Due to the inconsistency between the comparable valuation and the DCF valuation, I decided to take the average result in order to draw one price target for Lululemon. By doing this I arrived at an overall $LULU price target of $362/share, which implies a downside risk of 9.4%.

My plan would be to wait for Lululemon to drop 9.4% (or to the $362 price target) before buying in.

I prefer this plan over shorting $LULU because I believe in the long-term prospect of Lululemon, and Lululemon has big reactions to news and is very volatile in the shorter time frames.

**Catalysts:**

· **International Expansion:** We know that Lululemon is looking to expand further in China, Europe, and Asia. These markets are huge and can be very lucrative for Lululemon if they are able to capture this market. If Lululemon does this successfully, their future financial reports should reflect a large increase in revenues due to this expansion, which should excite investors.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon had a subpar financial performance. However, if they are able to fic this and report good earnings for the year 2021, they will get investors excited about the future growth prospect of Lululemon, which should help their price.

· **Q4 Earnings:** Based off of their seasonality I have estimated that Lululemon will beat their expected Q4 earnings. Obviously, I very well could be wrong here, however, if I am right their stock price should be benefitted by beating their earnings estimates.

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon did not have the best financial performance. Although there were some good aspects of it, I felt that the bad outweighed the good and resulted in an overall poor financial performance in 2020. If Lululemon continues on this path of poor financial performances in 2021 then investors may lose faith in Lululemon’s ability to continue their growth, and consequently exit their positions.

· **Seasonality:** As we know, Lululemon has historically experienced seasonality especially in their Q4 financial reports. This kind of seasonality has already been priced in, to a certain extent, however if the seasonality starts to fade and Starbucks misses estimates, their stock could be negatively affected.

8,investing,What is the best way to invest money for 2022 contributions in regards to taxes?,"I don't know it the tittle is clear enough. I have two investment accounts, my Roth IRA and My individual brokerage account. Both are 100% SWPPX.  My Roth IRA for 2021 is maxed out so I use my individual brokerage account to invest new money. Right now I have enough in there to max out my contributions for my Roth IRA for 2022.

9,investing,GOOG and GOOGL Divergence Today,"I fail to understand Alphabet's two stock classes acting so divergent today.

As background, they stopped making sense to me once GOOG (the non-voting share class) rose and stayed above the price of GOOGL (the voting share class) in 2018.  Just doesn't make sense as to why an equivalent share of stock, with the added benefit of voting rights, would trade less than the non-voting shares.  SMH.

But today's action has me baffled again... Why would GOOGL rise $100/share while GOOG looses a few bucks a share?  Did Alphabet announce a share buy-back for GOOGL and not GOOG, or is there something else I missed?  I read through the earnings coverage, but I did not find mention of this.

10,investing,What’s your thought process when analysing crowdfunding opportunities?,"I’ve started investing using Crowdcube recently just as another way to diversify. I was curious how other people approach these types of investments. I’ve not really approached it with any great strategy and I’ve noticed that I seem to invest more frequently in companies with a physical product/application. Obviously I’m thinking carefully about the proposition, customers, competitors, the valuation, future funding and potential exit routes. But it’s not a strategy that I could write down. 

What I’ve noticed, is that I seem to have a bias against app/software based companies and maybe I need to have a coherent strategy rather than just analysing pitches one by one to ensure I’m getting a balanced portfolio. When it comes to non-physical propositions, I think I’m just very sceptical of a lot of the software companies that seem to do something that already exists. For example there’s currently an app crowdfunding where you can split bills with friends. And I just look at that and think surely if this was going to catch on, it would’ve happened by now? And a lot of these companies I believe are going to have to spend endless money to acquire customers, let alone keep them. 

Whereas a lot of the physical companies seem to be much more disruptive, a lot of them seem to be in the climate/eco space which I like. A lot of them have some sort of patent protection. And so I’m much more interested in them. 

I wonder if anyone else who invests using crowdfunding could help me see more of these opportunities in the tech space as worthy of investment?",1627496830

Three years ago u/warrenfgerald made a great post about the problematic nature of the growing size of the Fed Balance sheet and was totally skewered in the comments for it. He came from a naive POV and was merely asking a question about QE and how the FED acts as an independent fourth branch of government. I wish i could say that Bernanke was a liar when he told Dr. Ron Paul that the FED would unwind to pre-crisis levels but that would be giving him too much credit. Here we are in 2021 with almost $10 trillion on the books and the most noted economists see this as highly problematic. For the first time in US history questions are raised if the Fed will step into the equity business (it already buys corporate bonds). This is insanity on every level and economists all around are worried about the ramifications. I dont have an attention span big enough to make this post longer and more detailed.

67,investing,China State-Owned Daily Urges Calm After Market Rout,"A Chinese state-owned securities newspaper urged calm on Wednesday after investors dumped mainland shares for a second day on worries over the impact of tighter government regulations.

Regulatory moves aimed at the education, property and technology sectors sparked heavy selling this week in Chinese markets, and have left global investors bruised and uncertain over the outlook for investments in Chinese firms. read more

In a front page commentary on Wednesday, the state-owned Securities Times said that systemic risks ""do not exist in the A-share market overall.""

""The macroeconomy is still in a steady rebound stage, and short-term fluctuations do not change the long-term positive outlook for A-shares,"" the commentary said.

""The recent market decline to some extent reflects misinterpretation of policies and a venting of emotion. Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilise at any moment.""

Other major securities dailies echoed the commentary in market reports.

In a front page story citing domestic fund managers, the official China Securities Journal said the sell-off was a ""structural adjustment"", a sustained plunge is unlikely and the market does not face systemic risk.

A story in the state-run Shanghai Securities News quoted domestic analysts as saying that the sell-off would not continue, and that the market will gradually stabilize.

""For institutions, the decline brings the opportunity for positioning in high-quality shares,"" it said.

What started off as a sell-off in shares on Monday had spread into fixed income and foreign exchange markets by Tuesday afternoon, sending the yuan falling through psychologically significant levels and pushing Chinese sovereign bond yields, and the cost of insurance against a default in China's dollar debt, higher.

I don't see myself taking this money and going high risk, it would be too stupid for me to contemplate.

BRK.B 5 year average - 94%

39,investing,The Continued Bull Market Hypothesis,"The Delta variant is not a threat:

1. Texas, Florida, Missouri and Arkansas account for 60% of new cases. These states will not shut down. They will let the delta variant run wild. Those governors do not care. It won't affect business, unless businesses voluntarily choose to close. In some cases, it may motivate more people to get the vaccine. The vaccination rate is much higher in the NE, West Coast and in major cities.  The delta variant will have less impact on these areas than it will in rural areas.

2. Vaccinated people who get the variant don't end up going to the hospital or die at the same rates as those without the vaccine. Vaccinated people are getting minor symptoms. Almost all hospitalizations and deaths are coming from unvaccinated.

3. The CDC believes that 4.6 times as many people have had the virus and not tested for it than have tested for it. This means presumably that these people who had the virus and didn't get tested were not sick enough to get tested. JPMorgan thinks that about 70-75% of people have either had the virus or had the vaccine or both. So while it is a little surprising that the Delta variant is picking up steam, it probably will begin to peak much sooner than pervious waves simply because more people have been exposed to the virus than with previous waves.

4. Hospital workers are vaccinated at a higher rate than the public. One of the biggest reasons for the shutdowns was to protect our front line health care workers. This can no longer be used as an excuse.

5. The public will not stand for another round of shutdowns. It's not our fault some people don't want to get vaccinated. 

Fundamentals and valuation:

1. Markets are not good at self correcting based on valuation alone. Markets use data points to determine valuation and most data points coming in now suggest a continued bull market. Strong earnings, favorable monetary policy, continued QE until at least the beginning or middle of 2022, few competing alternative investments, clear evidence of transitory inflation, and a rebounding economy that will not shut down all suggest this bull market will continue to go higher. While there may be some profit taking and rebalancing that could lead to a minor correction of 5-10%, the markets will probably re-inflate to the same or higher levels unless there is new data points that suggest the fundamentals are becoming negative. 

2. We are in an upside down market: any bad news is actually good news. This is because any variant threats actually lower the Fed's desire to begin tapering. The longer the Fed runs its QE program, the higher stocks will go.

3. A major sell-off this close to the last is really unprecedented. There is actually more precedent that stocks will become extremely overvalued than there is precedent that there will be another sell-off this close to the last.

4. Major market sell-offs almost always precede or coincide with a recession. Right now, there is not any evidence to suggest another recession is around the corner. And if there was, the Fed and the democratically controlled government would step up with more QE and another round of fiscal stimulus which would drive equity markets higher.

5. How much higher can the market go? The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a forward PE ratio of about 21.5x. Prior to the pandemic, it was trading at close to 18.7x. It's about 15% higher. I think that is easily justifiable based on the more favorable monetary climate alone. For comparison, the CRB commodities index is about 20-25% higher than pre-pandemic. Historically, investors have been willing to pay as much as 25x forward earnings for the S&amp;P 500. So it's possible the market may test that level in the near future, so that would be a 16% run-up in prices. This compares very favorably to the downside risk, which I believe is probably somewhere near 5-10%, which are historically normal amounts for the market corrections. And remember, timing the market underperforms time in the markets, so most of the time, it's better to hold than sell.",1627395918
50,investing,I am tired of people saying: Past performance is no guarantee of future results!,"When I tell my friends, neighbors, and relatives about my success in the stock market, most of them just roll their eyes.  They are not interested in the stock market and just put their savings in the bank.

When I ask them why they don't put any money in the stock market they say:  ""**Past performance is no guarantee of future results.""** In other words, they believe that just because the stock market may have done well in the last ten years does not mean they would make money going forward.  One friend said, ""just because you made money in the stock market last year, means nothing, it could crash and likely will never recover.""  I find this type of thinking is quite common.  They believe that past occurrences and trends mean nothing and tomorrow is likely to be completely different and unpredictable so it is best to play it safe.

54,investing,Odds of Toyota becoming the Blackberry/Nokia of automotives?,"Toyota’s top executives, [including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda](https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/), have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.

[According to *The* *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage), a top Toyota executive has met with congressional leaders behind closed doors in recent weeks to advocate against the Biden administration’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivise the shift to EVs. 

Last year, a group of car companies made a deal on tailpipe emissions with California, which had been seeking to set tougher rules than the US as a whole. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards.

Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well.

Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. 

With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has [revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru), including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.

But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; [*The* *New York Times* noted as much in this article from 2009](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html).",1627376093

The yield on the most actively traded 10-year government bond rose seven basis points to 2.94% Tuesday afternoon, the most since in a year. The offshore yuan fell as much as 0.6% to 6.52 per dollar, through the key 6.5 level for the first time since April. Stock benchmarks in China and Hong Kong extended declines, with the Hang Seng Index plunging as much as 5.5%.

“There is a widespread rumor in the market that some U.S. funds are selling Hong Kong and China assets aggressively, as the U.S. may restrict investments in these places,” said Li Kunkun, a trader from Guoyuan Securities Co. “Although we can’t verify if it’s true or not, the market fears that foreign capital will flow out from the Chinese stock market and bond market on a large scale, so the sentiment is badly hurt.”

Risk aversion has emerged in China after a sudden policy change on education companies followed crackdowns on technology firms, raising concerns on a swathe of sectors in the equity markets. Curbs in financing for the property sector, and signs of an expanding Covid-19 outbreak are also weighing on growth expectations.

Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.

But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.

Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.

The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.

""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.

Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.

In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.

Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.

Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.

""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said.

Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.

The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.

But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.

This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready.

""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

61,investing,"Meituan, Tencent And Other Chinese Tech Firms Continue To Plunge As Beijing Expands Its Crackdown","**As of typing this, the Hang Seng was down 1400 points. The last 3 trading days can be labelled as an official crash**

Chinese tech stocks are continuing their big sell-off as investors continue to digest Beijing's widening crackdown on private enterprise.

Meituan dropped 16% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, eclipsing Monday's massive 14% loss — making it the food delivery firm's worst two days on record.

That plunge — which combined, has wiped out more than $56 billion in market value for Meituan since Friday — came as Chinese regulators issued new guidelines Monday calling for improved standards for food delivery workers.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement that companies should take steps to ensure that riders make at least the local minimum wage, to reduce the ""intensity"" of the workload, and to ""strengthen traffic safety education and training,"" among other measures.

Meituan runs one of China's biggest food delivery platforms, with hundreds of millions of users making transactions on its app annually. The company said in a statement Tuesday that it had ""received and closely studied"" the new rules, and would ""strictly comply"" with them.

""We are committed to improving our compliance standards to protect the rights of our stakeholders, which include delivery riders,"" it added. ""We believe that the publication of the new guidelines will beneﬁt the healthy development of China's internet industry as a whole.""

Its shares have sunk more than 32% so far this year.

Other tech giants' stocks dropped, too. Shares of China's two most valuable companies, Alibaba and Tencent, also slid over the past 24 hours, with Alibaba closing down 6.4% in Hong Kong on Monday and falling another 4.6% on Tuesday. Tencent dropped 7% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, also extending Monday declines.

The Hang Seng TECH Index, a Nasdaq-like technology index that tracks the largest tech firms trading in Hong Kong, fell 4.5% on Tuesday, bucking the regional trend among many major indexes.

I think the market is greatly over-discounting the regulatory / government risk on names like BABA, JD, TCEHY and others. And today it seemed to turn from concern to sheer panic. I felt pretty good taking the other side on this.

Take BABA and AMZN which are pretty comparable companies. But BABA is trading at 22 PE while AMZN is at 70. If you consider the underlying businesses fairly comparable, then the market is pricing in a risk discount of 60-70% in that case!!

It's fine and necessary to discount China stocks for their many fraud / regulatory / govt / VIE structure risks. But the chance that a given Chinese company goes to $0 due to this is much less than 60-70%, especially the mega cap tech companies that are tightly ingrained with the govt and too big and visible in China to be actual frauds.

Summary
In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records. We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history.
Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team, including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year.
We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.
Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point. We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible

GRN has seen a 85% growth rate over the past year, increasing in value from $10.65 to $19.75 in twelve months.

In less than 24 hours, a 12-year-old child genius coder carried out  his own non-fungible tokens (NFT), making profits of more than US $  160,000. That boy is Benyamin Ahmed, the creator of the now-famous  collection “Weird Whales,” a sequence of photographs with multicoloured  pixelated whale shapes coined in the form of NFTs on the Ethereum  blockchain.

The NFT image of whale number 1,205 recently sold for around $ 6,000 and the total sales volume is almost 800 ETH.

Ahmed began coding when he was 5-6 years old, after his father, a web  developer for the London Stock Exchange Group, introduced him and his  brother to HTML and CSS.

“I created my first collection \[NFT\] on OpenSea just to have a little  fun, and then I got more interested in them when BAYC and other avatar  projects started rolling in. I also play a lot of games, from what I can  see NFTs come in handy as custom skins and cosmetics. ” He said

Each image in the Weird Whales collection, which can be found on the  OpenSea market, comes with a unique set of ‘features’ whose pixelated  design is evocative of the well-known CryptoPunks. Ahmed discussed in a  tweet thread how he used Python to help randomly create attributes for  over 3,000 unique designs that add to the value of each NFT.

This year, he used his summer vacation to study JavaScript and learn  more about computer languages. And, more lately, he has started to  investigate the NFT space. Ahmed, who enjoys video games, was  particularly intrigued by collectibles technology.

As a result, ‘Weird Whales’ started when one of the developers behind  another NFT project, Boring Bananas, handed Ahmed an annotated Python  script with a template to make his own tiered photos, according to  Decrypt. But the young man had no idea that his collection of 3,350  uncommon whales in NFT format would be so popular.",1627325706

**Conclusion**

	Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 

	The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

75,investing,Emerging markets - bit fed up with this lot.,"I'm a long-term passive buy-and-hold type of guy, and for many years I've held a small overweight in emerging markets (specifically Vanguard EM - (VFEM)).

I've never really lost faith as such in any broad-based index tracker, but I don't know, it just seems to perpetually underperform. Since 2012, VWRL is up 172% and VFEM only 59%.

My basic reasoning at the outset for having a slight overweight was that it would be these economies powering the long term future. Instead, it feels like they just continually suffer the worst combinations of natural disasters and government corruption pilfering profits.

So, I'm curious to gather views, do you still feel emerging markets are worth paying any attention to as a broad group for the long term 'boring' investor? 

Or are they only for those who want to be more active and select specific countries at specific times?

# BTI Fundamental Analysis 

&amp;#x200B;

# Price Target $50 – 28% Discounted 

  

## OUTLOOK

It is no surprise that e-cigarettes are fundamentally changing the tobacco industry. E-cigs have been around a while, but there is apparently less loyalty to certain old guard brands. Consumers are more and more health conscious, yet most likely conventional tobacco products will still dominant the industry for the next decade. Still, Big Tobacco companies are still investing into the new forms in order to win over customers. 

As of today, British American Tobacco has a very well hedged position in the new forms of tobacco consumption, thus preparing itself for a shift in consumer demand. Their Vype brand is becoming more and more popular in the United Kingdom, and they recently acquired Reynolds which gives them access to Vuse. In 2020 British American Tobacco spent GBP 121 million on research and development, yet that is much smaller than their competitor Philip Morris Tobacco who spent GBP 356 million last year. British American Tobacco (BAT) is also lagging in major new categories. In traditional tobacco products, BAT has taken 6% in Japan last year, but still not as much as Philip Morris. Nevertheless, BAT is determined to become more competitive and has set a target of GBP 5 billion of revenue generated from next generational products by 2025. Vaping has lower barriers to entry and lower profit margins than traditional tobacco by fire, therefore revenue growth might not be the key growth performance indicator. 

Notably, British American Tobacco has acquired Reynolds American to increase their stake in the combustible tobacco business. Reynolds American owns the brand Newport which still has a strong presence and consumer loyalty compared to others. Their volume is declining slower than others in the US and Newport’s are priced competitively. This is probably the major reason for recent weakness in British American Tobacco’s stock price as increased fears of menthol regulation and the strategic acquisition of Reynolds exposes BAT to the menthol category even more. 

## PRICE TARGET DRIVERS

My price target estimate for British American Tobacco ($BTI) is $50 which implies a earnings multiple of 16 times, 12 times enterprise value (EV/EBITDA), a free cash flow yield of 7%, and a dividend yield of 5%. For the most part, these estimates are mostly inline with BAT’s comparable of Philip Morris and Imperial Brands and the historical valuations that I pulled. I believe that this is appropriate given BAT’s positioning in traditional and next generational tobacco. 

The price target will all depend on BAT’s sustainability of the operating margins for the traditional combustible business, as I think that is what they are best positioned for. I assume a 1% sales growth which is below a consumer staples sales growth of 4% and below BAT’s comparable, Philip Morris. I am also assuming a volume decline over the next 5 years of 3%. Lastly, I believe the push to next general products, including vaping, will reduce the profit margins. I assume EBIT (earnings before interest &amp; taxes) is 39.5%, which is lower than last year. 

## SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

British American Tobacco holds a strong franchise in the tobacco industry, which is formed by their intangible assets and cost advantage. Obviously, government regulations in the tobacco industry have made the barriers to entry almost impossible. Consumers are also continuing to be brand loyal which is creating another intangible asset for BAT. Lastly, enormous tobacco conglomerates have the advantage of scale. 

### Intangible Assets 

Nicotine is an addictive substance which is hard to quit. Data from Tobacco Atlas states that more than 60% of smokers want to quit and as much as 42% have tried in the past 12 months. Nevertheless, globally smoking rates are barely declining which suggests that smokers have failed to quit. Also, academic research that I’ve read shows that failed attempts at quitting might be tied to premium price and brand loyalty. British American Tobacco has a very balanced cigarette portfolio, arguably one of the most balanced of all the major players. Their premium category generates around 25% of revenue, 33% in mid-tier categories, and the remainder in the affordable category. 

Government regulation combined with the fact that nicotine is addictive give BAT a competitive advantage as it reduces competition on prices. One example is that mass tobacco advertising is banned in most markets. New entrants into the market would have a hard time gaining attention. Also, the lack of marketing prevents brand switching and indirectly creates loyal customers. Compared to other industries, big tobacco doesn’t spend near as much as others in advertising. Only a mere 1.5% of sales is spent on marketing. However, it is possible that they will increase this as the next generation products, i.e., vaping is increasing in popularity. Furthermore, Point-of sale display bans don’t allow consumers to compare pricing and incentivizes brand loyalty. Therefore, manufacturers aren’t engaging in a promotional price competition. Another example of barriers to enter the tobacco industry is the US FDA. The marketing of new tobacco products is subject to FDA approval, which is not easy to get.

Brand loyalty remains loyal in the tobacco industry and I do not see any major changes happening in the near future. This is due to challenges to enter, regulatory barriers, and restrictions on marketing. Consumer brand loyalty benefits premium tobacco products more and puts British American Tobacco right in the middle of all of its competitors, such as Philip Morris and Imperial. 

### Cost Advantage

British American Tobacco’s business is very scalable. The more volume of cigarettes that BAT produce, the cheaper the production cost is. In 2020, estimated production costs of a pack of BAT’s cigarettes were $0.57 on a volume of 629 billion sticks. This is in the middle of their competitors, PMI and Imperial. 

### Good Sustainability 

Although counterintuitive in a declining industry, I believe that the British American Tobacco price target of $50 if appropriate because it is likely that the company will continue generating returns on invested capital for the foreseeable future. The sustainability of profitability and returns on capital will depend on future increases in tobacco prices that will follow inflation and declining demand. Based on past examples it seems that this is likely. In 2011, Australia implemented a series of anti-cigarette measures which led to more taxes being placed on tobacco. Over 6 years, the retail prices of cigarettes doubled and only led to a 3% drop in the smoking rate in the country. According to the World Health Organization, a pack of cigarettes now costs roughly $26 in Australia which is well above $17.80 in the UK, $6.50 in the US, and $5.50 around the globe. Assuming this example is applicable, there is plenty of room for Big Tobacco to raise their prices in order to continue being profitable. Therefore at 4% real pricing, incorporating a 2% global inflation, it might be two decades before British American Tobacco will not be able to generate rent. 

However, BAT’s recent acquisition of Reynolds American has lowered its return on invested capital generation (ROIC), and I would expect the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to remain thin. Now that BAT paid $49.4 billion for the 57.8% of Reynolds, it will be limited going forward for new acquisitions. However, I believe that BAT will still be able to create excess returns on capital. 

## CAPITAL ALLOCATION

Balance sheet leverage increased when British American Tobacco acquired Reynolds American. In my opinion, the deal created limited value. BAT paid 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA for the company, which lowered their ROIC. However, acquiring the product Newport and staying on top of the competition will provide future benefits, similarly in 2011 when BAT acquired Protobacco for 11 times EV/EBITDA. 

Management has also been somewhat of a problem for BAT. In April 2019, Jack Bowles, former COO of the international business, replaced by Nicandro Durante as CEO. It is still uncertain how Bowels plans to turn the business around. Now with the growing demand for next generational products and with that comes lower profit margins, I would want BAT to focus on profitable growth vs revenue growth.",1627201601

85,investing,An interesting pattern in underlying price,"**Hypothesis:** Higher priced stocks return more proportionally to capital invested than lower priced stocks and with less risk.  
Possible conclusion: any investor should try to own as much of the highest priced stock they can if all other considerations were the same. So pick good returns from better valued stocks and stop gambling in the brambles.

Picking 4 stocks to test this hypothesis:

**Criteria** \- strike price should be delta 0.3 (-0.3) or lower delta. Price represents several tiers of expensiveness. ***IV has to be similar and BB has special commentary.***

BB ($10); GLW ($42); AAPL ($150) and I'll skip the next tier ($250) but that'd go to something like MSFT. Lastly we'll examine AMZN ($3600). So 4 tiers.

Basically 10s, 40s, 100s, low-to-mid-1,000s.

**Parameters** \- Do a Delta-30 covered strangle on the underlying - then divide the total capital by the premium. Similar IVs and Deltas mean those variables are less of a factor than the underlying price.

* The value of the underlying is not a consideration - only the capital is a consideration. It is assumed you bought the underlying at the price it is today which isn't ideal. But it assumes you will not be assigned at either strike price so do not realize any gains or losses from the underlying.

**BB - July 30**

* Call @ 11
* Put @ 9.50
* Net Credit: 24
* IV - 0.773 and 0.665 (Call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.22%

**GLW - July 30**

* Call @ 42.50
* Put @ 40.00
* Net Credit: 84
* IV - 0.464 and 0.422 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.03%

**AAPL - July 30**

* Call @ 152.50
* Put @ 146.00
* Net Credit: 345
* IV - 0.387 and 0.354 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.17%

**AMZN - July 30**

* Call @ 3740.00
* Put @ 3580.00
* Net Credit: 9375.00
* IV - 0.414 and 0.382 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.29%

**Comments on the IV:**

I had trouble finding a stock in the 10 dollar range that could support options equal to the majors. BB had some liquidity so went with it despite its higher IV. It's IV is about double AMZN's so if you adjust for IV it probably would have a payout similar to 0.60% to 0.80%. But, even at almost 2x the IV of AMZN it doesn't beat AMZN's return.

**Conclusions**: While this is by no means scientific, I think there's strong indication that for a similar IV, you're being paid more proportion of premium the higher up the price ladder you go. Another way of saying this is you're assuming more risk to get the same returns the lower down the price ladder you go. And therefore an investor should try to work their way up the price ladder as fast as possible.

A path might look something like buying GOLD (Barrick) in the $20s tier until you accumulated enough to then sell it and buy NEM or XOM or MO or BAC in the $40s - $60s tier, then trade out for JPM, AAPL, JNJ, PG, ABBV, etc. for the $110s - $150s tier then jump ship to MSFT in the $270s tier, TSLA in the $660s and AMZN in the $3,700s.

The idea is that premium on options represents how much return a stock can return, and if the premium is higher on stocks with similar Greeks but the only difference being the price, then we can assume that the price itself improves returns and the longer you invest in lower prices the more risk you expose yourself to, and the less returns.

BB is a great example.

No matter how much capital you put into it you get 1.22% return on premium, for twice the risk of AMZN.

And BB might fail while AMZN is going to space. Literally. Along with SpaceX and Virgin Galactic (SPCE). By the way, SPCE's IV is way too high right now to be reasonably compared to GLW, AAPL, and AMZN.",1627182729

26,investing,A long-short momentum ETF needs to exist.,"Statistically, momentum trading has merits as top performing stocks over the past year, 6 months, or month tend to beat the market by 2% on average. This also applies to the short side where the worst performers continue to go bad often. A long-short strategy has the added benefit of uncorrelated returns to the market, meaning that a market crash is unlikely to effect this portfolio as losses on the long side are made up for gains on the short side.

The original hedge fund combined this with stock picking, and frankly that's how most of the thousands of hedge funds work these days. The thing is, we can cut costs and make this strategy accessible to everyday investors if we were to simply automate the process into an ETF by buying the top 50 stocks and shorting the bottom 50 stocks. We could have two versions of this ETF, one unleveraged and one 3x leveraged.

I personally have no means whatsoever of creating this products, but I would totally buy it if there was. Hopefully if the idea floats around here long enough some fund manager will get a bright idea.

29,investing,Won't climate change and population decline slow down stock market growth in the next few decades?,"If climate change does end up slapping us in the face full force then we will be seeing more floods, more forest fires, droughts, and hurricanes. All of which cause severe economic damage and may lead to some areas becoming permanently uninhabitable dead zones.

Add to this the issue of a slowing/declining population. The population growth in many western countries is slowing massively and many will be facing a declining population. This is leaving us with a huge burden of elderly people which the young workers will have to support through higher taxes. Doesn't this decrease the level of consumption that drives the economy? When there are fewer people able to consume?

----------------

On the other hand I hope to see us pull together as a species to fight and hopefully reverse climate change. With harsh regulations on emissions and with future technologies at our disposal maybe this will be achievable. 

And with the declining birth rate, depending on how much credence you give to the longevity movement we may start seeing medicines and therapies that make people live longer and more importantly healthier lives making them less of a burden on society in old age. I'm not sure how soon we would see these treatments available though. 

Most importantly I can see automation becoming the cornerstone of the economy as workers start being phased out in trucking, warehouse, and factory jobs among many other physical and nonphysical sectors. Maybe this will give the economy a huge boost and increase production massively. This obviously poses questions about what happens to the unemployed.

Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet gave an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much.

How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD?

What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue? Will they charge more for other manufacturers? How do they set that up?

Will Tesla start manufacturing the semi soon? Do they have enough 4680 cells? Which location will be producing 4680 cells next, and is the final process completed?  

What the status on the updated cybertruck, and when will it be updated to show any other features? The 8 ton press has not arrived in Texas yet for the cybertruck castings.

What grid scale battery projects are they working on now?

What is delaying the S right now? It's hit pause on deliveries at the moment. Was the plaid fire a cause for concern on the battery?

38,investing,Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Additional Actions to Prevent Foreclosures,"On June 24th, the Administration extended the foreclosure moratorium for a final, additional month until July 31, 2021 and the forbearance enrollment window through September 30, 2021, and provided up to three months of additional forbearance for certain borrowers. These actions were taken by three federal agencies that back mortgages – the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) provided similar relief for mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Specifically, where agencies have the authority and depending on homeowners’ financial conditions, agencies will require or encourage mortgage servicers to offer borrowers new payment reduction options to help them remain in their home.

HUD: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced enhanced loss mitigation tools and simplified a COVID-19 Recovery Modification to help homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These options will offer borrowers appropriate relief while preserving flexibility for future crises. FHA will require mortgage servicers to offer a no cost option to eligible homeowners who can resume their current mortgage payments. For all borrowers that cannot resume their monthly mortgage, HUD will enhance servicers’ ability to provide all eligible borrowers with a 25% P&amp;I reduction. Based on recent analyses, the Administration believes that the additional payment reduction offered to struggling borrowers will result in fewer foreclosures. To achieve those goals, HUD will implement the following options over the next few months:

COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim: For homeowners who can resume their current mortgage payments, HUD will provide borrowers with an option to continue these payments by offering a zero interest, subordinate lien (also known as a partial claim) that is repaid when the mortgage insurance or mortgage terminates, such as upon sale or refinance;

COVID-19 Recovery Modification: For homeowners who cannot resume making their current monthly mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Modification extends the term of the mortgage to 360 months at market rate and targets reducing the borrowers’ monthly P&amp;I portion of their monthly mortgage payment by 25 percent. This will achieve significant payment reduction for many struggling homeowners by extending the term of the mortgage at a low interest rate, combined with a partial claim, if partial claims are available.  
These options augment additional COVID protections HUD published last month. These included the foreclosure moratorium extension, forbearance enrollment extension, and the COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification: a product that is directly mailed to eligible borrowers who can achieve a 25% reduction to the P&amp;I of their monthly mortgage payment through a 30-year loan modification.  HUD believes that the additional payment reduction will help more borrowers retain their homes, prevent future re-defaults, help more low-income and underserved borrowers build wealth through homeownership, and assist in the broader COVID-19 recovery.

USDA: The USDA COVID-19 Special Relief Measure provides new alternatives for borrowers to help them achieve up to a 20% reduction in their monthly P&amp;I payments.  New options include an interest rate reduction, term extension and a mortgage recovery advance, which can help cover past due mortgage payments and related costs.  Borrowers will first be assessed for an interest rate reduction and if additional relief is still needed, the borrowers will be considered for a combination rate reduction and term extension. In cases where a combination of rate reduction and term extension is not enough to achieve a 20% payment reduction, a third option combining the rate reduction and term extension with a mortgage recovery advance will be used to reach the target payment.    
 
VA: VA’s new COVID-19 Refund Modification provides multiple tools to assist certain borrowers in achieving a 20% reduction in the dollar amount for monthly P&amp;I mortgage payments. In some cases, even larger reductions are possible. One such tool is the new COVID-19 Refund option, where VA can purchase from the servicer a borrower’s COVID-19 arrearages and, if needed, additional amounts of loan principal (subject to an overall cap corresponding to 30% of the borrower’s unpaid principal balance as of the first day of the borrower’s COVID-19 forbearance). Similar to VA’s COVID-19 partial claim option, the COVID-19 Refund will be established as a junior lien, payable to VA at 0% interest. In addition, servicers can now achieve significant reductions in the dollar amount for monthly payments by modifying the loan and adding up to 120 months to the original maturity date (meaning the total repayment term can be up to 480 months).
 
FHFA: HUD, USDA, and VA’s steps bring federal agency options closer in alignment with payment reduction and loan modification options for borrowers with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. FHFA’s existing COVID loss mitigation options provide servicers with homeownership retention tools for borrowers. The tools include a payment deferral option that allows borrowers to resume their pre-COVID monthly payment after deferring up to 18 months of missed mortgage payments into a non-interest-bearing balloon. The missed payments do not have to be repaid until the homeowner sells or refinances the property. Borrowers requiring more significant help may receive a loan modification that targets up to a 20% reduction in their monthly mortgage payments. The Flex Modification (Flex) capitalizes all past due amounts, extends the mortgage up to 40 years and in some cases lowers the interest rate and provides for principal forbearance. 
Additional Assistance

In addition to these new opportunities for borrowers, agencies across the federal government are also taking other steps to support borrowers as our economic and public health recovery continues.  

Homeowner Assistance Fund: In addition, the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF), a critical component of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, provides $9.961 billion to states, D.C., territories, and Tribes for relief to homeowners impacted by the COVID-19 economic crisis. These funds can be used for assistance with mortgage payments, homeowner’s insurance, utility payments, and other specified purposes – and homeowners can access these funds in addition to the payment reduction options discussed above. And they will be integrated into the payment reduction options outlined above – providing additional payment reduction to borrowers who need it and to borrowers whose mortgages are not backed by federal agencies.
Extended Term Option: Finally, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) recently announced it is creating a new security product for modified loans that would provide government agencies the flexibility to extend mortgage terms to up to 40 years, if they choose to do so, for borrowers who are behind on their mortgages and would benefit from the monthly payment reduction associated with this option.  Ginnie Mae expects this extended term product will be available for use in late 2021.
Giving Borrowers the Information They Need to Understand their Options

These new loan modification and payment reduction options will only give borrowers the relief they need if borrowers have the information to understand their options.

Homeowners can visit consumerfinance.gov/housing for up-to-date information on their relief options, protections, and key deadlines.
As federal agencies continue working to implement housing assistance for American families, CFPB offers this website as a one-stop shop for homeowners to learn about programs and resources that can help them stay in their homes by reducing the risk of eviction and foreclosure.
Borrowers should contact their servicer or housing counselor as soon as possible to learn more about the options available.

Last month, HUD, VA, and USDA announced steps to ensure that no new foreclosures are filed on mortgages backed by those agencies until borrowers are reviewed for new and improved options to make their monthly payments more affordable.
In addition, FHFA will continue to work with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure that borrowers are evaluated for home retention solutions prior to any referral to foreclosure.
The CFPB finalized a mortgage servicing rule that requires most servicers to meet temporary procedural safeguards before filing foreclosures for most mortgages through the end of the year. The CFPB’s rules also require that mortgage servicers provide information to borrowers about their options.
For borrowers not currently in forbearance, there is still an opportunity to access relief. 

HUD, VA, and USDA announced that they will continue to allow homeowners who have not taken advantage of forbearance to date to enter into COVID-related forbearance through September 30, 2021.
Homeowners with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-backed mortgages who have COVID-related hardships will also continue to be eligible for COVID-related forbearance.

I first started buying in feb 2021, so my cost average is kinda high and im just spending all my money DCA and buying under my average to bring it down. Plus i really do believe in the assets i invest in and i believe that it will give me the most capital gains, besides metals (Silver), i dont own anything else that would grant me large capital gains. I also want to save enough for an FHA loan down payment for a home i can house-hack and rent out. I dont have that much cash saved, but i do transfer it to a stable coin and stake for almost 8%APY. 

Dividend stocks i haven't bought in 10-11 months which is fine because im young so once crypto goes back up and the bull market resumes i will put money into divs again. Physical metals are the smalls part of my portfolio which im okay with because again im young, but would still like the exposure and its nice to collect.

4,investing,Dividend Irrelevance Theory and Factor Investing,"Dividend Irrelevance theory is the belief that dividends do not impact total returns. Basically, for every dollar a company pays out in dividends, that is a dollar they do not have on their balance sheet, so a share of a company is effectively worth that much less, making the whole transaction irrelivant. It's for this reason that many smart investors suggest that chasing dividends is a bad strategy.

While dividends themselves are irrelivant, why is it that companies that pay dividends have provided higher historical returns than companies that do not?

Much of this can be explained by exposure to [Factors](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/fama-french-5-factor-model/)- most notably, the value factor, profitability factor, and aggressiveness of investment factor.

On average, companies with a low price to book ratio(value) historically have higher returns than ones with a high price to book ratio, Profitable companies have higher returns than unprofitable ones, and Companies with conservative asset growth have higher returns than companies with aggressive asset growth.

Dividend payers in general tend to lean towards these factors. A company that pays a dividend generally has conservative asset growth, as it must limit the rate it expands to be able to pay out the dividend. A company that pays a dividend generally targets profitability, as a steady stream of profits is required to maintain a dividend long term(and unlike buybacks, dividends are usually seen as more of a commitment)

And a company that pays a high dividend usually has a low price to book value.

Many professional investors target Factors to enhance their returns. Unfortunately, there really aren't any good ETFs or mutual funds that target all of these factors at once while maintaining low fees. This is especially true of the profitability factor.

However, by buying a dividend-based fund such as VYM, you get some level of indirect(but not perfect) exposure to these factors. It's not going to be perfect, as it will miss out on some value &amp; profitable companies like BRK that don't pay dividends, and include some currently unprofitable companies that pay high dividends(ie, in 2020 it would continue to hold XOM even though it is unprofitable). It may also occasionally sell profitable or value companies that cut their dividends.

But as a retail investor, this is the closest you can get to indexing with a factor tilt other than buying individual factor funds like VTV/VBR. The problem with many of these ""value funds"" is as follows:

1. Many of these value companies are not profitable, and are only considered value because of inflated valuations of assets on balance sheets. For example, Carnival Corp is included in many value funds despite being far from profitability. Profitability is a very significant factor in returns, and Value funds fail to screen for this.

2. These index funds only reconstitute annually. So Unprofitable companies like AMC and GME will continue to be held even after reaching highly inflated valuations. 

In addition to the factor benefits of dividend funds, there is also the liquidity. If you may need to withdraw from your portfolio, the advantage of dividends is they generally decline much slower than market price during downturns. This means that you will need to sell less shares of a high dividend fund to fund your expenses than a general market fund.",1627071572

6,investing,Question for people who are smarter than me...,"Let me lay out the basics here. I am semi educated in personal finance, not anything professional. It is simply something I enjoy researching. So I know the basics. 

I am 20 years old. My goal is to max my ROTH IRA every year. (14k Vanguard)

other than my ROTH IRA I have a normal brokerage in Vanguard with about 12k in there.  

I also have a chunk of 9k sitting in TD Ameritrade, which isn't invested in anything. My hope was to invest this in individual stocks. I was okay with the risk. I wanted to become more knowledgeable in finding strong stocks and buying them.

I have no debt and my next year of business school is paid for. I have about 3.5k left in my savings with 2 months left to work. which will be 6k in my savings for next year. I live with my parents for the next two months so a cheap rent, gas, and small costs here and there is all I have to worry about. 

However, with working pretty much a full time job I have not had a ton of time to be able to do the research. Besides, I really only know the basics that were taught on TD ameritrades education center. I have messed around with the papermoney on Think or Swim and actually found a couple stocks that have done well, but of course I did not do it with my actual money. 

So my question is should I just ditch TDA and move that chunk of money into indexes on Vanguard. Probably some small cap value, REITs, or someone with good growth.

A lot of naysayers who don't understand the concept chimed in, that's fine, I eat their downvotes like salty tears. MMM sooo good.

But the simple fact remains based on this I stated the INTC price would begin to recover end of day. Sure enough...Boom \*mic drop\*",1627069692

16,investing,What is this strategy called? or is there a term? Selling Options etc,"So example.

I own no stock so far.

ABC Stock is $10.

I sell a covered put where when the ABC stock goes to $9.50, I will buy ABC 100 stocks @ $9.50 for $ premium.

The ABC stock eventually goes to $9.00.

Thus I automatically own 100 ABC stock.

Then I sell a covered call, where if the ABC stock goes to $11.00, I will sell ABC 100 stocks @ 11.00 for $ premium.

The ABC stock eventually goes to $12.00.

Thus I automatically sell the stock at $11.00.

So in this scenario/summary, my profit is $11.00 - $9.50 = $1.50 x 100 = $150 + $premium I got from selling the covered put + $premium I got from selling the covered call?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone, please correct anything that I said incorrectly, such as incorrectly using certain terms, understanding and whether there is a term to call what strategy this is?

26,investing,Investor? Could you create a 100 stock portfolio that beats the best Growth Mutual Funds most of the time?,"My best friend, who is retired and has lots of time on his hand is spending a good part of his day researching stocks and investing real money in about 100 different companies.  He has bought stocks in all types of industries and has about an equal number of Small Cap, Mid Cap, and Large Caps.

For years he told me how great he was doing but I doubted if his success was real.  Until he started to show me his actual portfolio five years ago and I started to track it online.  At the end of each year, I compared the results against what I determined were the best growth mutual funds available.  In each of the last five years, he has beaten my target mutual funds in total return. (I told him he would have to give me 1.5% for the mutual fund fees expense.)

To the investors out there who buy and sell individual stocks, could you beat the best mutual funds year after year if mutual fund fees were eliminated from the calculation?  Tell us your story!",1627057439
27,investing,INTEL - Why is it down on such good earnigns?,"TL;DR - *price moves down on positive earnings for a complex options-play reason and you need to look at how within the expected move the price change was.*

This is a concept I'm still trying to get my head around as well, but it's generally true. Earnings seems like a confusing time, good earnings sends a price lower, stocks on bad earnings sends a stock higher, why is the world upside down?

Perhaps someone can give a more technical explanation but it largely has to do with the ***bull put spread*** options strategy to capture expected moves.

An options trader in this strategy doesn't care that the price might go down somewhat - as long as it stays within the spread (**the expected move**) they make money. Quite handsomely.

Because an option's inherent volatility is dependent upon how negative the gamma is, as traders pile into ***puts*** to take advantage of the UPSIDE of a good earnings report while covering their potential downside, they cover their downside to within the expected range and not less.

They could cover it more but then you're eating at profits.

At the risk that if the expected range is bigger you lose everything (100%).

So as IV increases, gamma negativity increases which in turn means institutional investors **now need to sell stock when selling puts.**

Because institutional investors need to remain directionally neutral so they make money off the spread of selling puts and calls to buyers....to remain directionally neutral when their gamma is negative they need to sell.

This is why a BULLISH SENTIMENT drives the price like a tent peg right into the ground.

It's a temporary phenomenon of a very smart play where you can't lose as long as the earnings is bullish...you can easily lose if the surprise is negative and the sentiment turns bearish. But most people know when a stock is expected to have a good surprise and a company like INTEL was definitely bullish.

**Conclusion:**

* *A lot of bull put spreads were bought,* 
* *gamma became negative,* 
* *institutions with $billions invested had to sell short to remain directionally neutral,* 
* *price comes down.*
* *Evaluation of bullishness is how close to within expected range a stock moves. The closer to the expected range the stronger the bullish sentiment on th earnings. After all 300% returns aren't free. If something is good, it gets squeezed down into 8% returns or so.*",1627056954

I feel the expense of these funds is going to eat away at her long term earnings and that she should ditch the advisor and just manage her money herself by putting it into broad based ETFs like VTSAX.

57,investing,Can a company create new shares?,"Tldr; Is it possible for a company to create new shares that are not in it's treasury?

I own stock in the company I work for. It's a micro company and it trades OTC. 

Recently shareholders (myself included) voted to allow employees to buy and own company shares at a small discount during certain periods (after earnings reports etc). The document reads like the company will create new shares out of nowhere to sell to the employees. I didn't know a company could create new shares. Wouldn't the company have to have equity to sell as new shares? 

I'm using my company as an example but I'm more interested in the broader market. As an investor do I need to worry about a company creating new shares and diluting the stock? I'm not worried about a company selling existing shares from it's treasury and diluting the free float. I look at the value of the entire company, not just the float. But if a company can create new shares that are not in the Treasury that's like the fed printing new dollars. It decreases the actual value of each share and would be more like stealing.

62,investing,How to successfully invest in a tech startup,"First of all why? On one hand it’s seems to be one of the riskiest investment ever, on the other hand VCs (investment firms) are hunting tech startups and throwing money at them

The biggest advantage of investing in a tech startup is it can scale infinitely and quickly that’s why even if VC will have many unsuccessful investments the successful once succeed so big that the losses are covered. As an example an early Uber investor invested 100k which turned into $300M or 30,000% return 

Individual investors can’t afford to make too many risky investments but they have an asset that VC don’t have, as an individual investor you are not under pressure to make quick decisions and make a lot of investments, in case of VC they have to invest in many startups at the same time because they are managing big capitals that has to be in use. It’s a calculated numbers game for them

So how do you , as an individual investor, invest in a startup with a minimum risk and with the potential to create generational wealth. You need to look for couple of indicators: 

- how scalable the business is 
- Does it require labor or most of it can be automated 
- Can that startup Aquier customers at a profit or can it at least break even 
- Does the startup has good app/web app design 
- Is the app well coded and does not have lots of bugs 
- Does it have successful rivals 
- Would VCs be interested in this type of business 
- Would bigger companies potentially be interested in buying the startup in the future

As an individual investor you need to catch this startups in the seed round because once they passed the seed round they might start to get VC offers which individual investors will not be able to compete with

Making money in finances not in sales 

Here is how typical business makes you money. You invest in it, the business sells products or services and the dividends of the profit is distributed among investors 

Here is how you make money in tech startup 
You come in as a seed investor let’s say you put $100k for 10% of the company. the company starts to acquire new users-customers maybe at a profit or loss. It reaches certain amount of users and popularity to a point where a VC gets interested to invest in it. Let’s say in the first round it gets $5M from VC. Remember you had 10% of the business that you paid 100k for, now it’s worth $500k even if the business isn’t profitable yet. Well now the startup has $5M, the substantial amount of which will be put into marketing of the business. The business is growing and it’s time, you guessed it right, for the second round of VC financing, let’s say they put $20M, remember your 10% that you bought for 100k? Now they are worth $2M. Without the startup even having to be profitable. Now if at this point the business has 20k - 1M users the big companies will start to keep an eye on it and may even make an offer. Let’s say they offered $50M to buy the business, and now your 10% is valued at $5M without the business ever making any profits. 

A good example is Telegram app,it does not have any revenue yet but is valued at $30B.

You may ask, where is the value? Why would someone be so much interested in a business that is not generating any profit?

The value is in the future profits and in the user base that a bigger business can merge with. That’s what happened with WhatsApp and Facebook, FB used WhatsApp to share data with its social network.
