2,personalfinance,Random card in mail from Netspend All-Access by MetaBank,"My MIL received an unsolicited card from Netspend and I read through it to find out it was just an offer.  However, this reads very much like someone supplied information for a new account and they were mailing out a card (true plastic debit card, not one of those paperboard ones) with a bank acct and routing number, debit card number, and full name and address.  This card is very much for a checking account.  Netspend is apparently used by some for their government benefits (my research found it used for regular benefits as well as some COVID and tax refunds).  You can also sign up for their cards and checking accounts, but the unsolicited ones are, likely, just offers (read that fine print) that need to be shredded.  

I'm sharing my experience as, during my research online, other posts asking 'what to do with these cards' did not produce any language that confirmed my suspicions of it being an offer.  There was a previous post in r/personalfinance about 6mo ago, but it did not include language.  Several older posts seemed unrelated to this situation or were specific to COVID relief.  I do recognize all cards are different and language is not always the same, esp. with time, but I wanted to help anyone else looking for help.  For me, the language just below the card reads:

""***This card is not a credit card****. Identity verification and card activation is required to use all Account features or to add money. If you do not want this card, please dispose of it securely. No credit report has been or will be obtained in connection with this offer. We obtained your name and address from a third-party data provider. This card was not sent to you in response to an application...""*

It also provides opt-out instructions which I won't share here as it includes phone numbers, email, and address info and I don't want to break any rules. 

Hope this helps others in the future, if nothing else, to encourage them to find that magical fine print in the mountain of paperwork they send.",1632488826
4,personalfinance,Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit - Can I claim it if I'm renting the house I'm installing solar panels on?,"Long story short, I'm currently renting a house from a family member that I will be purchasing from them in February 2022.

If I get them installed in January 2022, would I be able to claim them on my 2022 taxes since I will be the homeowner *that year*, but not the homeowner at time of installation?

9,personalfinance,Rule of thumb for fun budget for a disabled (aka unusual life situation) young adult,"I’m 20, with no job but I currently get 900€/month and will for a few more months because of disability (this might be extended but I can’t be sure as of right now). I live at home and my parents agreed to not make me pay bills for now (as I currently don’t really know where I’m heated, they say “you can save up for now”), so my only expenses are on myself (clothes, transportation (don’t have a car, can’t drive), food, and going out/miscellaneous).

Since my situation is pretty different from other young people being in college and/or having jobs, I’m wondering how I should go on about my savings and finances in general. I currently have 5000€ in my savings account, and I put most of my income (~70%) in savings every month, keeping the remaining 200-300€ in my checking account for the month, but I never fully use that so any leftover goes into savings the next month too.

What would be a good rule of thumb to allow for fun money? By fun I mean going-outs with friends that require money (cinema, small events), eating out, or more exceptional expensive “purchases"" like concert tickets, an item like a console or a new phone etc.

I’ve seen a few people say that 10% of your income (or leftover after bills) is a good amount, but obviously 10% of 900€ is A LOT. So then I was thinking 5% (45€) but even that seems way too much per month for me considering I’m at home all day and barely go out/barely buy stuff. But then again I don’t have any obligatory expenses and might not for a while. Sure, this doesn’t mean I can automatically “spend more” ; saving more is always good and that’s what I’m currently doing, but I’m afraid I’ll feel too deprived someday and spend a big amount on something when it’s not the best time and/or I’d feel extremely guilty; and not having a real budget makes all of this very blurry. Everything has such a different cost and I have no current ""purchase/saving goals"" (like a specific thing I’d like), so I don’t know what I should put towards it. 10€ per month? 20€ ? 30€ ? More? Less? None? I feel like this budget method can’t apply to me either?

When I say I don’t really have any expenses planned for a while: the only thing that might change this is that in a few months (I still haven’t gotten a real entry date), I might start in a school-like program, in a city that’s 1 hour away, so my expenses will be a bit more onto transportation and food since I might live in (paid for) dorms during the week, and maybe have to get some school supplies here and there but I’m pretty sure it won’t be huge amounts/very different otherwise. My rule is continue saving a good bit (for overall future, and for that) but I know my parents will be able to help if I really need somehow so I don’t have to 1000000% worry about it either.

This is pretty all over the place I’m sorry. Gonna try a TL;DR: 900€/month with barely no bills, will continue being this way for a while. ADHD so no visualization of any budget whatsoever despite thinking I’m able to somewhat picture one (I am not). I’d like to start putting some money away in a “fun budget” (from small expenses (eating out, cinema…) to big ones (festival, new phone…)) outside of my overall savings, but I don’t know how to go on about it. I already save ~70% of my income each month right away. Not sure of the amount I should add because I don’t go out all the time nor buy things all the time [so I don’t need a big amount every month] BUT every unused bit each month will carry on to the next month, so if I want to save for a big purchase I technically can. What % should/could I add?",1632487881

27,personalfinance,FHA loan refinancing to conventional to drop MIP.. is my closing cost with it?,"Hello everyone! Looking for some guidance with refinancing my home.

I purchased a home for $279,837 with a 30 year FHA loan at 3.5% in November 2019. Been living in the property for a little less than 2 years. Currently owe $270,000

Based on “online estimates” my home can be worth between $340,000 and $380,000.

My MIP is about $190 a month and the only way I can remove that MIP is by refinancing to a conventional loan.

I received the refinance estimate and I was able to get a 3.25% on a 30 year conventional loan (my credit score is about 680.. not that great) 

I received another estimate for 3.125% at 25 year conventional loan.

The issue I see here are the closing costs. The lender did give me the option to do a no cost closing where they can roll the closing back into the mortgage. However, my closing costs are about 7-8k.. 

Not sure if I am doing this math right but in order to break even it would take me about 3.5 years. $8000 closing /$190 MIP= 42 months  / 12 months  = 3.5 years

I would be saving $2,280 + the bit of lower interest

In your opinions, would it be worth it to refinance to remove the MIP even if I’ll be basically restarting my mortgage back to 30 years with a loan amount of about 278,000? It almost feels I’ll be starting over.

If someone can give me some advice, that would be great. Thanks!",1632474488

46,personalfinance,Discover closed my CC on me; why I love them for it,"So, between 2012 and 2016, a lot of stuff went really sideways in my life; and I made a bunch of bad financial choices. I had accrued about 40K in credit card debt in addition to my mortgage and two auto loans. I was definitely not making good financial choices. I waa never late, but barely covering minimum payments, and often ended up going back to CC's just to cover living expenses. I spent a couple of years flailing around considering bankruptcy, feeling hopeless about my financial future.

Early in 2019 I suspect my financial behavior triggered alarm bells with Discover and they thought I was in very high risk of defaulting. They probably saw my financial doom coming. At that point I hadn't put any new charges on Discover in a year or two. While I don't believe they were being altruistic, they sent me an offer; close my account and agree to a fixed repayment term. Their web form asked what I thought I could afford, and I told it $170, somewhere around $25 to $50 more than my minimum payment was. What was I getting in return? They would drop my interest rate. The system ran its numbers, and then said if I agreed to fixed automatic monthly payments of $170 for four years, they would drop my interest rate, to.... 0.99%

I took this offer, and used it as a catalyst to start snowballing my CC debt away. Along with some bonuses and stocks from work, and this year refinancing my CC's into a 4.99% APR personal loan I made significant headway. By March of this year I had only the Discover card with any balance on it (but still a 15k personal loan that had been used to pay off the outstanding CC balances). I've even got my 401k contributions to the maximum matching levels, and HSA contributions nearly maxed. It all started when I got the offer from discover that allowed me to start making real progress on paying down that debt instead of stuck treading water in interest. I recently changed jobs and got a signing bonus and paid off the remaining Discover balance. It was only at 0.99% so I realize that it could have been better suited to elsewhere, but it just felt goo having no CC debt out there.

I will begin putting into my new job's 401k as they do a 6% match and I wanted to begin investing more in retirement but wondering what I should do with my old one.

I made $60k at my prior job but just started my new one and I'm making double that now.

\- 4.5% matching 401(k) &amp; PSP pension plan (extra money)

For the past few years, I have contributed $6,000 to my IRA. This is the first year in which I will be making over the $65k MAGI limit (I file single), so I will not be able to make the full $6,000 contribution to my IRA. However, I will still be making under $75k. The guidance I can find from the IRS is below:

My question is - what exactly do they mean by a partial deduction? Is it prorated so that if I make 70k (for example), does that mean I can put 3k (half of the 6k) into my IRA since it’s halfway between 65k and 75k?

60,personalfinance,Chances of getting approved for home loan?,"So I have a great opportunity to buy my great uncles home that has a balance around $200k and worth $350k here in California.

He told me that if I give him $10k he’ll sell it to me at the remaining balance of the loan. I would love to jump on it since houses are $350k+ in Cali.

66,personalfinance,Played myself on a car loan (24.99%),"First off, yeah, I played myself. I realize that.

&amp;#x200B;

That aside, I just signed up for a 60-month loan at 24.99%. The car itself is about 14k, and the loan is about 11k-ish. I'm working about 35 hours a week currently. The monthly payment is $412 a month. I'm 20 years old and I'm a 3rd year in college.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I bought this car was because I was initially planning to save until our current beater car (my brother's) died. Well, it died very shortly after making that plan. I had a down payment of about 3k. Now I'm fucked. The reason my rate is so atrocious is because we literally don't have credit, and the issue the car was having was a transmission issue, so I essentially panic-bought a 25k dollar car.

&amp;#x200B;

The state I live in does not have a cooling-off period.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to skip this next part. It's just numbers. I'll give a tldr after this next part.

As far as my finances goes, I currently have an income of 2619 and a total expense of 1590 (car is 412, insurance is 250, rent is 600, internet is 188 (but I'm gonna disable unlimited, so maybe 120ish soon. My Excel file has 188 listed, though), electric is usually around 125. Phone is 15 a month). The rest is my brother's half. Assuming I can live a ""frugal"" life of 290 on misc expenses (85 for gas, 100 for food, cat + lizard for 40, hygiene for 15 and other for 50. Although I feel like I'm missing something), then \*for now\*, I have a total of 1029 in pocket money. Thing is, this only last for about 4 months. I get paid for going to school due to a program that's the result of foster care, and the ""real"" net is 342 after those 4 months. I also get around 2k from FAFSA after classes are deducted, although I plan on going to a uni next Fall, so I'm only gonna get that 2k one more time.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, long-story short, assuming I first establish a safety buffer of about 1k (which I have about 600 of currently), then I can throw about 6kish (maybe more if nothing major happens) directly toward the principle. Thing is, again, I don't have a credit history. How much of a benefit would I be getting if I stuck to it until next FAFSA (ie hold out for 6 months while chugging leftover money toward the principal) then refinance? Would I not be totally fucked? Or am I still pretty fucked regardless?

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate, a few questions: is there a rough guesstimation of what my APR would look like in 6 months? How would I go about calculating that when I have a more concrete number?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since the APR is reliant on credit, would it be wise to get a credit card SOLELY FOR GAS and paying it off instantly to establish credit? Or should I simply steer clear of that?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to my understanding, I can take back a warranty (yes, I paid the warranty). For the sake of avoiding financial ruin, should I cancel the warranty? Or should I stick it through so I can have live consistently harsh but more or less avoid pure fucking pandemonium if/when the car has an issue? I mean, having my last car fuck up is the reason I'm here to begin with. Although, that's kind of an excuse. I did this to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I remain eligible to all of my college programs even if I take a gap semester. I won't get the 500 a month, but I could replace that with a 2nd job. Do you think it'd be a good idea to trudge along for 6 months, finish my classes, then work a 2nd job over Summer and next semester, refinance again (or wait to refinance \*until\* then?) and then return to classes?

&amp;#x200B;

As-is, my living situation is fine and stable. I live with my brother but he's pretty reliant on me currently and we've already planned to stay together for the next 3 years. No issue there. And again, my programs remain eligible. For the sake of security in the future, should I take the gap year?

67,personalfinance,Asking for advice in helping my widowed mom protect her retirement portfolio,"My dad passed away a year ago. He managed everything with regards to their finances. My mom doesn't have any financial literacy and is scared to talk/think about her finances. I am doing my best to help her learn, build her confidence, and take ownership over her finances. Let me tell you, it's been very time consuming and emotionally exhausting... but I'm trying to do right by my dad and the right thing in general to help her... so here we go:

I was talking to her about how I am concerned about the market, and what she could do to protect her assets. 

She has no debt, she owns her home, she has SS and pension income.

Age: 62

State: FL

Tax deferred state retirement account: 225k
She has this split evenly between in 2 conservative funds: one is stable value which is bonds, Insurance, and mortgage equities, the other is built to withstand inflation and is also heavy in bonds.

Some of the companies listed in the fact sheets in these have bonds with Evergrand. I may be wrong, but I currently view bonds as being risky because so many institutions are heavily leveraged, and can default in the event of insolvency (like in a market crash).

On the flip side, govt officials are selling off their stocks, inflation is up, reverse repos are high.... lots of red flags for in the stock market.

To be clear, I am new to all of this because I've stepped into this role of helping my mom navigate life without my dad being around. I'm doing my best by researching and reading, but I have a lot more to learn.


We were weighing options with pulling money out of the market for a time, put it in savings, and buy back in when the market is more stable at a later point in a taxable brokerage or or non tax deferred investment. I personally wouldn't do this with my portfolio, but I am much younger and expect to weather a couple more recessions. I do believe time in market is better than timing the market. But given my mom's age, I don't know how to approach this. Also, she is a just hundreds dollars away from being bumped up to the next tax bracket for this year. So I am resistant to having her withdraw anything for the remainder of this year.

Her retirement service does offer a self directed brokerage that enables her to keep her funds with this service, as opposed to rolling it over elsewhere and not being able to go back in to this service. She really wants to keep her money with the state, while I'm not entirely convinced that the state performs better than other services out there. But once you pull out, you can't go back in.

Here's an idea, and tell me if I'm wrong or crazy:

Would it be safe for her to pull a portion of her assets out of these 2 funds and place them into this brokerage account, and not buy any stocks/bonds? Just let her money sit there until we can come up with a better long term solution?

Note: i know full well we need a financial planner, but she got cold feet with one before and ended up wasting his time and it was a frustrating situation 😑  she's now convinced that she needs one (she does), but she can't even hold a basic conversation about anything finance/investment related. She doesn't know basic terminology,  and is scared/easily overwhelmed. I'm afraid she's not learned anything from last time and she'll get cold feet again.

TLDR: can you move retirement funds into tax deferred self directed brokerage temporarily to buy time to weigh options? I'm assuming that we are headed towards a crash/market downturn.",1632456338
68,personalfinance,Mobile home vs. Single family home - What is better,"My husband and I are at a total disagreement of what our “first owned place” should be. 

My Husband wants “simplest living”. He’s frugal, dosent believe we can afford any type of housing, and he’s been constantly been influenced by those RV/Van type shows along with some co workers living in mobile homes. His uncle owned a trailer park and found those to be very nice. 

I don’t like the idea of a mobile home. I don’t like any type of HOA (which I feel many trailer parks/mobile homes have) many only allow a certain breed or weight (one even said height….) of dogs. My dog (40-45lb coonhound mix) would not qualify in most (if any) of those mobile/trailer parks and there really no privacy or yard that I can enjoy sitting outside or do any sort of garden work.  Certain trailer parks I feel are more shadier or untrustworthy and there’s not a garage to protect my car from theft. 

I would like to get a single family home. I want the freedom to be in my own backyard and have my dog alongside me. Plus, no HOA. I’m not looking for the biggest or expensive home, I would be just fine with a 2 bedroom 1 bath home with a small/decent size backyard. I wouldn’t mind an older home either.

I see the cheapest provider is KLM, it takes me to the KLM website. The ticket price for the cheapest fare (lite) is $724, however that would not include baggage. I then change it to the flex package which does include the baggage, however for the return it only allows me to choose lite. (This is fine because i only need to take checked there not back) It lowers the price of the return stating “promo fare”. So due to the promo the cost stays the same at $724. 

I have screenshots of this entire thing proving the include baggage. I also checked after booking and it’s still there. However after I receive my email ticket it shows no baggage included.

I try to contact the KLM representatives through live chat on all available places, no response. I call once and they say to send the screenshots and call back in 3 hours. I call back and after an hour long call, the guy who was clueless the whole time ends up changing his mind and says that the ticket automatically sets it to the weakest fare option for both, which makes no sense but ok.

 I was very persistent the whole call, showed the screenshot proof, and even showed an identical booking, showing that it would be included before you pay. I even stumped him because he was claiming it was not shown on the booking, and then I directed him to where it was. Immediately without thinking he does a full 180 and says that the fare would be the weakest option. I told him that makes no sense as to what was shown.

89,personalfinance,What are my rights in disputing a false collections claim by a business?,"Long story short, a dental office started sending me invoices for outstanding claims over a year after my last visit. I know this must be wrong. I know my insurance paid for everything, and I know I couldn't possibly owe this much even if insurance didn't pay, so I contacted them to dispute it and they ignored all my contact attempts and never responded.

Recently they started using a collections agency. I only know because it showed up on my credit report and severely damaged my credit score and I was notified by Credit Karma. The collections agency has never even contacted me.

Is this even legal? Can they just send this straight to a credit report without even trying to contact me first? And could the business even send this to the collections agency after having refused to talk with me? This all feels like a scam; they're insisting from a one-sided ""conversation"" that I owe them money when in fact, I do not.

I have 135k in a mass mutual index fund at the moment. It has grown about 12k each year. 

If homes in the area I am buying (NJ commuter town near NYC) historically grew 3.4% annually not including the pandemic growth - **does it make fiscal sense to liquidate some of the 135k from one investment to be able to put more down and have more liquid for repairs and unexpected home costs if we plan to stay for at least 10 years?** I am not moving to make money, but if taking money out is a terrible idea I need to reconsider things. 

The math according to an online appreciation calculator predicts a 420k home now in that area in tens years could sell for 580k. 

All of this is market dependent, the mutual fund on the stock market and the house housing market so it's in no way a guarantee and I realize that as well as the taxes I will pay on any funds taken out.

I gross about $68k/year (household income of around $110k) and am 18 years into a 25 year retirement.  Our retirement system is structured so that at 25 years of service or 60 years of age, one can receive benefits equaling 2% of salary/year of service with COLA annually.   At 25 years of service I’ll be 44.   This job is very secure and while the retirement system isn’t perfect, there is no immediate sign of danger or substantial change. 

Recently I’ve been presented with other job opportunities and am curious as to how I should value the pension against other offers.   These particular opportunities pay anywhere from $20k-$60k more, but are out of the current retirement system.  There is no reason to believe similar opportunities wouldn’t be present in 6-ish years when I am at retirement age.

1,personalfinance,Social Security checks and income level question,"My mother receives a social security check, she draws it from my fathers account (who passed away while at work). I do not claim to fully understand how SSI works, but my basic understanding is that she receives a certain amount each month based on how much my father paid into social security before he passed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

There also is, apparently, a limit to the amount of income she can earn in any given year. If she earns more than that amount, the SSI check will be lowered to compensate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year she earned over the limit (I am not sure what it is exactly, but do know that it is not much at all. Our family is not very well off, barely over the poverty line.) and the first few checks she received were drastically lower. This month she was notified that she has to contact the office to update her employment pay scale so that the amount of the checks can be re adjusted. Also, without any warning, her most recent check was about 1/4 of the typical amount. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has come to me to ask about her options, I told her that she would either need to get her pay cut or flat out quit her job if she wanted to keep getting these checks at the current level. She asked for a pay cut but the company she works for would not lower her pay (I know, I didn't believe it either!) and they can not cut her hours any because the place is understaffed as it is.

Looking for some advice in Australia on a personal loan and I’m in the dark as to how loan applications are assessed. I have some pretty major credit card debt of approx $50k across 3 cards after years of terrible budgeting and very frivolous spending. 

I have a decent wage of $1400 p/w and am lucky to have a good rental which is cheap for where I live. My other bills are not too extravagant.

I’ve realised I need to knuckle down and pay off some debt and have managed ~$10k off so far. I’ve never fallen behind on payments and have a very good credit rating on credit websites. 

Paying off this amount so far has taken a lot of staying in, putting every extra dollar not on bills into paying down the debt, and getting creative to get some extra cash to put toward it too.

I’m wanting to take the pressure off a little and apply for a personal loan to consolidate what’s left with the remainder of my car loan, so approx $50k all up.

I’m nervous I will be knocked back for a personal loan - does anyone have advice as to what I can do to help my chances? Looking into the application, I will have around 1/3 of my salary p/m left over after all bills are covered. This is a good position to be in? Does the ratio need to be better than this?

We max out his Roth IRA at 6k/year and then add another 500/mo into a brokerage account for him as an extension of the Roth. I put 1000/mo into the SEP IRA. We have about 30k combined in retirement savings right now, and plan on getting more aggressive with it as we continue to earn more money as we get older. 

We have about 25K in cash that we keep in two savings accounts - one that we use regularly for joint expenses, and one that is our ""backup"" emergency fund that sits in a money market account. 

We have a mortgage on our house at 2.75% interest but we live in central Austin so equity on it is growing pretty fast.  

On top of that - we have an additional 30K that I currently have sitting in a joint brokerage account. We don't want to put it into our retirement savings because we want to keep it available for eventual house renovations like building a backhouse or buying additional property..or use it to take a year off and travel. We're already covered for emergency money - so I'd like that 30K to make additional money while it's just sitting there, but more than a money market account would get us. I don't anticipate touching it for 2-5 years. I'm not sure I want to invest it into an SP500-style ETF due to the higher risk for a short term account.

Hello everyone,

I received notice from the IRS that I was being charged for failure to file for my 2020 tax return. I used a private tax preparer and had him submit everything, but there was apparently an issue with needing a PIN from a dependent that I was not notified about. 

My tax preparer claims he was not notified of the return being rejected and when I checked the IRS site for the status, it showed as “not processed” and never showed as “denied” or something similar. I checked the site frequently and it never updated.

Is there a case here to get the charge dropped or is it more likely that my tax preparer is simply not telling the truth? I noticed in the tax payer bill of rights that the taxpayer should be notified if there were any issues but nothing regarding a preparer.

My question is, what are some ideas for a liquid investment that it is either a set term or very liquid? What first came to mind was treasury bonds. I know they're low risk, I can set 3/6 months, but the return is only a little better than interest rates at bank. My other thoughts were stock market. I already have some money invested in crypto and a dividend portfolio. Maybe put some in index fund. 

I am open to ideas, mostly serious ones but silly ones are appreciated also. Thank you",1632442021

He sent me a link to one 600 sq ft 1br in Williamsburg for 400,000k s claiming that since I previously made very little I will qualify until my income increases and that as long as I qualify when I purchase it and the coop board approves me then it’s all kosher.

36,personalfinance,Need advice on how to discuss with my mother who has terminal cancer that she is falling for a scam.,"Hey everyone, I'm sorry if this is not the appropriate sub for this but I see people often talking about scams on here and figure you might be able to help. Sorry for the long post as well.

TL;DR: mom is talking to a incredibly sketchy person she met on a dating site. Guy is currently in the UAE ""drilling for oil"". We have told her multiple times that this is a scam and she keeps brushing it off. Any advice on ways to convince her that this is a scam?




Here's the background:
My mother was recently diagnosed with non operable cancer and the outlook is not very good. She has been on dating websites since before this happened. She is definitely the type of person who would not keep her condition a secret (she has a very attention seeking personality) and I have no doubt she has put this information up on her dating profile somewhere. 


She does not have a ton of money, and is getting close to retirement. Because of the chemo treatments, she has not been working and I'm unsure that if she were to pass, she would be entitled to life insurance through her work. 




Okay, so here's the full situation. 

A few weeks ago, my mom started talking to a guy on a dating website who is ""a body builder that owns a gym in Las Vegas. He says he wants to come meet me, but has to go to UAE because he's working out an oil contract with a prince there."" Yes, I know, somehow this scam is still a thing. Unfortunately, she is blinded by a picture of an attractive man with abs and seems to believe what he is saying to her. Apparently he has called and spoken to her and they have prayed together on the phone, and he has ordered food to be delivered to her house (I'm very upset that she gave this person her address). My brothers and I have all voiced our concerns separately and she is brushing it off.

He keeps telling her that he wants to marry her and when his contract goes through, his money will be her money. He has told her he wants to pay off the student loans for myself and my 2 brothers. He has told her he will buy a house for each of us wherever we want.

My brother was with her today and she showed him a picture of the contract so he would believe it was real. In his words: ""This guy wants to get married to mom in December. She showed me his ""contract"" for the oil thing for the United Arab Emirates. Literally looks like someone copied and pasted everything and uses ""u"" instead of ""you"". I told her it's 100% fake and she needs to recognize it as a huge red flag, but she kinda just brushed me off""


We plan on having an intervention with her tomorrow when my younger brother and I can be with her in person and can conference call our older brother in. Has anybody ever had a relative/friend who you have had to talk out of a scam? How did you approach it? Do you have any suggestions about what we should say?",1632439307

My loans have an interest rate of 6% right now, and my payment starting February 2022 would be $666 a month, unless I go on IBR which would lower it to around $190-200 a month.

Is paying the minimum and investing my excess income a good idea?

Interest is prepaid through October, so no payment due on October 1 - our first payment isn't due until November 1.  We went from a 15 year to a 30 year but still intend to make the larger, shorter term payments. The new APR ended up close enough to the old one that having the option of dropping our payment to the lower amount in case of emergency made sense.

I input the current amount, rate, and extra payment amount into the Bankrate amortization calculator and it comes up with the same numbers; the only difference is the month that the loan is paid off.

My thinking is that the ""extra"" payment at the start should knock down the interest, and that that should compound at least a little by the end. I'm not sure if that's because the calc on that site doesn't account for this quirk of refinancing, or because it just doesn't make a difference.

How can I calculate this?  TIA",1632433588

73,personalfinance,First Time Fraud/ID Theft Victim,"Hi everyone, 

background story: Received a credit alert through one of my credit accounts that a new inquiry had been made from a bank. I contacted the bank and they confirmed someone did apply and was approved for a credit card. They also agreed and confirmed it was fraudulent after exchanging personal info. I acted quickly, so this bank was able to freeze the account before any spending occurred. 

But now I have a hard inquiry on my report and my information is out there. I am planning on doing the following and would really appreciate any feedback:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Freezing my credit with all 3 bureaus. I'm told this is free and will not affect my credit. The process of having to unthaw your credit for new future applications sounds like no big deal.

\-Possibly place a fraud alert on my credit report? Looks like this is free, some quick searches say no affect on my score. What do you guys think? 

\-Dispute the inquiry with each bureau to hopefully have it removed. Should the disputes be preceded with contacting the FTC?

89,personalfinance,Need Opinions on my financial plan," 

Hey Everybody,

After reading through countless posts, investing ideas, and budgeting ideas I have come up with my own financial plan. Please give me your thoughts on it.

1. Solid budget and stick to it. Any excess after bills goes to emergency fund, then a small vacation fund, then investing. By 2022 I want to max out my 401k and work on maxing out a roth ira (step 4)
2. Build up emergency fund. I want to get 6 months of expenses into extremely safe liquid assets, or high yield savings. Currently at 15,000 out of 25,000 needed.
3. Build up small vacation fund or just fun money so I can do fun things. Ex: vacations, massage, video games, go out to eat. This fund will be need to be replenished if used before investing. My job as an accountant is extremely stressful and takes up my time Mon-Fri, and during busy season I lose my Sat. Busy season is Jan - April 15 AND Sept 1-Oct 15. Currently at $0 out of $5,000. It honestly feels that all i do work/eat/sleep repeat.
4. Invest the rest into ETFs or Mutual funds that follows the S&amp;P closely. Try not to overlap to get most access. Only touch this if I am in dire need.
5. Decide on a term life insurance policy that is convertible or ends after 30 years.",1632430260
90,personalfinance,"Unexpected credit limit... bad thing to close one, or good to leave it alone when I'm done?","So for 5+ years, I've only had 3 credit cards... one with a $9000 limit (~11 years old), one with an $11,300 limit (~9-10 years old), and one with a $5500 limit (~4 years old).  I never touch two of them but an occasional tiny charge just so they don't get closed, and only use one as my ""daily driver"".

I recently applied for two new credit cards... one to become a new ""daily driver""/use-for-everything card because the rewards are better, and another just to use really quick for ~3 months because it has an insane $1000 cashback reward.

Well... I was approved for both.  That's not surprising, my credit score has been 810-820 for years.  What was surprising is that one of them came with a $22,000 limit and the other with a $25,000 limit.  I didn't think either would be **that** high.

-------

All that being said:  I was originally going to just close the crazy-good rewards card right after pocketing the reward, but now I'm wondering if I should leave it open and just stuff it in a drawer with the others?  I know they say a higher limit is always good, means your utilization% will be lower, yada yada yada... but is there a thing as too much?

I went from $25,800 as my overall limit to $72,800 literally overnight.  That *feels* like it would be bad, but is it?  And if so, once I get the cashback reward, should I close the $22,000 card/account just to bring that overall number back down?

So many questions, mainly just because I am very surprised at the limits I was approved with, and am just inquiring from a long-term/future-creditscore standpoint.

The PR agency is in Raleigh, NC.The job has healthcare, benefits, 24 days of vacation. The starting salary is $50k

Both jobs are currently remote but will be going back to the office in the future, meaning I would have to move. 

So now I’m stuck in the middle. I could follow the job that makes more money in DC, but my money would stretch further in Raleigh. The job in DC looks better on paper bc the organization is more well known.

5 weeks ago I began the interview process with a startup. I gave my salary range as 115-145.

5,personalfinance,Advise on Refinance,"I’ve seen a few refinance questions but none that really aligned to my exact situation. Wanted to get your thoughts on whether my math below is correct and what you all think. 

We are looking to do yard related home renovations. This is to not only make our yard more usable, but also safer for kids. We ROUGHLY expect this to cost about 75k. Without touching emergency funds, wed be able to finance this in full by next year. 

I’m 14 months in to my current mortgage. I can cash out 71k while lowering my interest rate from 2.99% to 2.75%. Refi fees total 2k. 

My math is as follows:
Refinancing would increase my payment by $175/month
175X12X30=63k

Accounting for the 16k in interest ive paid over the last 16 months:
71K subtract 2k in fees minus lost interest payments of 16k equals 53k true cash in hand. 

This means I’d essentially be paying 10k in “interest” in order to finance the home renovations over a 30year period instead of financing it all up front. 

Two questions:
1. Does that math look right?
2. Do you think that’s a smart move? (For context, We would look to keep this cash we would’ve spent in case good investment opportunities presents itself. If we don’t end up investing it somehow, we’d essentially be letting inflation eat at it. That’s the risk/reward we are weighing. Is that 10k over 30 worth keeping our cash on hand).",1632428467

I refinanced my mortgage and also opened a new credit card in the same month. Always had a consistently “excellent” score of 820. After that month, my score dropped almost 60 points to 766. Then, the next month it dropped again 6 points, with the only difference being less utilization (7% to 5%).

I understand part of the drop is due to the hard inquiry required for the refinancing (I have now 1 inquiry over the last 12 months), as well as the average age of my accounts falling due to the added CC. However, my # of accounts now includes two installment loans rather than 1. Will my closed loan (original mortgage) always show up in my total # of installment loans, even if paid off? Is this affecting the huge drop in my credit score? I checked my credit report and didnt see anything out of the ordinary.

I am not too concerned about the 766 score, I was expecting a drop, just not this much. Wanted to confirm if this is normal or if its being calculated incorrectly due to the # of installment loans.

18,personalfinance,Inherited a life insurance policy from grandmother,"Hello,

My grandmother recently passed and we found out that she has had a life insurance policy on me since I was around 2 years old. I am 29. It isn't much - a little over $4k. The premiums are $4.30 a month and the interest is 4.5%. I believe it is a ""whole life"" but I am not sure.

I am currently in debt (about $20k - 75% is SL at ~2% interest and the rest is frozen/closed credit card debt) and considering cashing out this policy to pay some debt off. I am wondering if this is the best move, if I can possibly get more out of it by selling the policy (I'm not terminally ill and only 29 so not sure if that is possible) or if I'll shoot myself in the foot some years later by making a short sight-sighted move.

Additionally, my job offers me free life insurance which pays the same payout as this policy ($40k - 50% of my salary).

I am severely behind financially due to unemployment and using my early 20s to travel the world. I only recently opened up a 401k and am focusing on becoming debt free and building my credit score.

Either way, I end up in the same place in about 4 months. I guess I'm wondering is it better to go about the next 4 months saving $400/mo and paying $400/mo towards debt, or pay everything off and save $800/mo.",1632425425
22,personalfinance,"[URGENT] - Am about to join parents mortgage to lower payments- now thinking of not doing this- will talk to mortgage person 2day,make final 'decision'- need arguments against?","This is urgent, as in 2 hours from now i make my decision

Long story- parents are making payments on house i live in, they are trying to refinance, due to recent job changes on their part, they don't qualify for a refinance. Father approached me yesterday suddenly asking to add me to mortgage- which lowers their payments by a couple hundred or so.

I agreed, talked to the mortgage person on the phone slightly who ran some basic thing- parents and I both have exceptionally good credit, i make a decent bit more than my mother though.

So they started the process of sending paperwork to sign- but i hopped on here and saw on on the front page things about this, and dug into it- and apparently it'll affect my ability to get a house in the future- and even though i probably won't get a house anytime soon as i think i'll apartment hop once i leave this place to try to start getting higher salaries every few years - it'll apparently still affect me.

Mortgage guy didn't mention this at all. 

Also even worse apparently i can't just leave the mortgage after a year if what i read on here is true- they'd have to stand on their own, and while parents would better off financially now saving more money- they wouldn't have a higher income, and their credit scores are already very high.

So, in a few hours I will talk with the mortgage person, to ask him this stuff. I'll be asking, 
-will this affect my ability to get a house in the future, 
-how can i get off the mortgage if i get on it
how does this affect my own ability to buy a home for the firsttime
-i'd have to have a way bigger salary than my average one to be able to get a 2nd mortgage, right? 
and so on

and then, make my 'final call'

I've seen some places on the internet suggest that you can sometimes try to ask them to consider the fact your parents presumably made their last 12 payments, and ask for that to be considered so you can apply for a mortgage without them being in consideration without having made any payments on the mortgage you're part of, but even with that- i am leaning hard against now

The other option-

I have quite a bit saved up, and my parents have some credit card debt. It's a bit- but i can easily take clear it. i'm thinking i loan my parents the money to do that, that would allow the refinance- it would not be as good as if i join, but would get 90% of the way there. I know this was considered yesterday, both they and the mortgage person weren't fans of this since it's not as much of an impact on the payments. Now that i know though that there's downstream effects though- i am leaning hard towards doing this.

Can you 
A. help provide me with more ""questions"" to throw the mortgage person's way, perhaps that will 'highlight' the impact to me down the line that are solid ammo for not doing this even with the possible minor mitigations i've seen might be out there? 
and B. help with reasons to help persuade my parents that this is a bad idea for me to do? I DO believe if i bring a bit of ammo to this fight in that angle, they won't be that far behind agreeing with me that it's harmful- but i need evidence- and getting that in the form of ... downsides , preferably that come from my talk with the mortgage person, would help 'even though i might already know them from asking this, here, now , a few hours earlier)


I've kept exact figures out of this as i realize the mortgage person could see it if they look on reddit and perhaps get a clue. Might also need to delete this later, but it's a throwaway-

23,personalfinance,Investment opportunity offered by family,"I googled ""financial advice reddit"" and got here. Sorry if this is the wrong sub. If this isn't appropriate then please tell me what would be.

A family member just told me that an investment firm is purchasing the company they work at with the intent to sell the company in a few years time. This family member and I have a great relationship, and they are very honorable.

IDK the specifics of the deal, but some employees have been given the opportunity to go in on this deal and receive a commensurate payout when the firm sells the company. This firm plans to sell the company in 3-7 years, with a projected return of 2-4x. If you put in 20k, and the firm sells the company for 2x, then you receive a check for 40k. Seems straightforward.

This family member is in good shape financially; they are putting in their own money in far beyond the minimum required of the deal. I was told by them that if, for some reason, they lose their job before the company is sold, then we get our money back. I am not required to join in order for them to get the deal; they are not desperate.

The way I get on board  this deal is by giving them some money, which they put on top of their contribution, and they pay me my share when the company is sold.

I'm not financially illiterate, but IDK anything about this kind of deal. I've never heard of anything like it. I told them I have no problem putting down 5k because that is a small part of my portfolio, but I wanted to do more research before I put down any more.

My wife and I are looking at moving from our current home to a larger one now that our family has grown. We could (potentially) net around 60k in selling our current home so I would like to capitalize on that. However, I am in sales and my salary fluctuates wildly. I have around 15k in savings and I do not want to dwindle that if I can help it.

I have around 60k in my 401k so why would it be a bad option to borrow say 20k from it, use that as a down payment on the new house, sell my current home for a profit and use that to immediately pay back my 401k and leave myself some savings in the meantime? I know that this potentially means I would lose out on some earners in the meantime but I should be able to sell my current home (hopefully) within a few months, pay it back with a portion of the profits, recast the mortgage on the new place using a portion of the profits as well, and then restock my savings with the remainder of the profit to offset the costs of paying double mortgages for a few months and moving costs? 

Please let me know if I am way off base with this line of thinking.

44,personalfinance,Months of medical claims were missing Primary Insurance information,"As the title says, I’ve gone most of 2021 without properly providing all my insurance coverage.

For context, I’m 22 and still using my parents’ insurance. I was dual insured under both my father and stepfather. However, as of September 1st, I’m now covered under my mother’s employee plan rather than her husband.

My situation is as follows:

Since January, I was under the assumption that my father’s plan was my primary coverage. This is because a divorce agreement required him to provide insurance to my siblings and me; It also just seemed to make sense that a father would provide primary insurance before a secondary guardian. I’ve since learned that, when insurance companies coordinate benefits together, the member with the birthday that occurs earliest in the year is designated to be the primary payor. My dad’s birthday comes after both my mother and stepfather, so his policy has been my secondary plan all year.

I recently received notice from my dad’s plan requesting evidence of coverage documents from the other plan. After comparing the claims that have been submitted this year, I found that my primary insurance was missing from nearly all of them. For a bit more context, my dad’s plan has an individual deductible of $3,500 and my stepdad’s plan was $1,000.

·         3 claims from an emergency room visit in January totaled around $4,500. They were only processed through my secondary insurance and I was deemed responsible for $2,300 of that amount.
·         3 more claims for doctor visits and DME were again processed without the primary insurance in February. This totaled to approximately $1,000 and I was deemed responsible for $844.27.
·         The only claim that was ever processed with my primary insurance was in March. I got a new $10,000 insulin pump and secondary wouldn’t even speak to the supplier until the other plan had been added. After both policies, I was only responsible for around $1.500.
·         Since March, I’ve had 4-5 different claims totaling around $2,500. These claims were never processed by the primary insurance. When initially processed, I had copay around $90 for these diabetic supplies. However, months after these transactions, the plan denied the claim and requested the evidence of coverage from the other plan. Without that document, I’m theoretically responsible for the entire amount of $2,500.

Clearly, if I want my secondary plan to pay, I need to give them the EOC from the primary. To get the EOC from the primary, they need to be billed in the first place. I’ve already reached out to the customer service department for each company that was missing the primary to request reprocessing of those claims.

I come to r/personalfinance because I found last night that a collection agency had reported a derogatory account in early August to a credit bureau. The were 2 bills I was unaware of, and thus didn’t pay, were from January and totaled around $1,000. Personally, I think it’s pointless that doctors bill you separately through their group practice in addition to receiving a hospital bill. You’d think working at the hospital, you could just bundle it all together in one bill, but I digress.

I was able to find a statement mailed to me that had been dated 9/12/2021, meaning I do have time to dispute the bill. I plan on contacting the collector to see if they had purchased the debt or are attempting to collect it for the original party. Knowing that amount would most likely change once insurance is billed correctly, I’ll obviously want to reach out to the bureau to hopefully keep my record clean. I’m curious as to how I would go about best handling this situation. I’ve thought about reaching out to the group practice that had originally billed me to see if they would reclaim the debt while I wait for my insurance companies to duke it out.

67,personalfinance,Do I have too much debt?,"Quick disclaimer... I know that my situation is not a bad one at all. I'm not about to ask if I'm financially screwed, this is more of a ""am I thinking about this correctly"" kind of thing.

I find myself always thinking about my financial situation and justifying everything as being perfectly fine, and if I'm actually doing as alright as I think I am. I've made this as brief as possible:

Combined Income (wife plus me, both 30 years old): **$185,000 before taxes.** 

**Debt:**

\- House: $325,000 (Home value approx. $1 million, 1.9% interest)  
\- Additional Mortgage: $200,000 (2.4% interest; 3 vehicles, some home renovations from last year, and some debt from my previous life)

**Assets:**

\- Cash: $120,000  
\- One of the vehicles is a collectible: $120,000  
\- Photography Equipment (side business): $15,000, although obviously depreciating

We net around $11,500 per month and our total expenses including mortgage payments, bills food etc are around $6000. So theoretically we can save a conservative $4000 per month. 

I guess in this case if you factor in debt vs assets, the total net is $730,000

My fiance and I have no plans to have kids and we don't plan on moving out of this home for another 2 years or so. We live about 40 mins north of Toronto, ON Canada, and plan on moving to an area with lower house prices after 2 years. So we should have around $250,000 in our savings by then.

The $120,000 car was something that was in the family. It means a lot to me for reasons which I will not get into. I enjoy absolutely everything about it, even if it just sits in the garage. 

Assuming our income stays the same - would this situation worry anyone? **Again. I know some people have it much, much worse, and I am absolutely grateful for my situation.** But would love to hear from somebody in a similar situation",1632420598
68,personalfinance,Help managing future planning around interesting windfall and tax liabilities,"I've been a long time Reddit lurker and never felt the need to create an account to actually post until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some help deciding how to proceed with planning my family's finances going forward. I have read through all of this sub's wiki and many of the posts...

&amp;#x200B;

We are a 3 person household in a major Texas city. Both adults work and are in early 30s. Child is in preschool. She is currently self employed and grossing about $5-10k/month, but could reasonably(and may decide to soon) find a job making $110-150k/yr. He works for a software company and makes $140,000/yr with good benefits and potentially as much as a 30% annual bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

To our surprise, at the end of next month, his existing stock options(appreciation rights) will convert to actual company shares and mature/vest, yielding somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 in value. This money can be be left as shares or can be cashed out as capital gains. We do expect this to rise in value over the next 5-10 years significantly faster than the overall market, perhaps as much as 500%(based on company's plans and our perception of the reality of said plans). It is a private company, so we are as yet unsure how easy this would be to liquidate later, though we will be able to liquidate at current value for this window before the end of year.

&amp;#x200B;

He also has ESOP shares that will be worth approximately $75,000 at that same time. These must/will be cashed out, but can be reinvested as shares(for this brief 1-3 month window) after paying the taxes. I believe it is treated as a retirement account, so it may face early withdrawal penalties if we don't move it to something like a 401k or IRA. I believe we earn too much for an IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

Also at the same time, the company will be paying out the annual bonus. We believe it will be roughly $35,000. 75% will be cash, 25% will be ESOP cash.

&amp;#x200B;

He currently puts 10% of each paycheck to a 401k and has 3% matched by the employer. She payed roughly 12% into 401ks at previous employers, but has not setup a retirement account since she's been self employed these last 5ish months.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the main cause of this post. We both grew up poor and poorer, so have little experience managing money, investments, etc. Our move up into six digit incomes has been in the last threeish years.

&amp;#x200B;

We own a $450,000ish house with about $300k left on the mortgage at roughly 3.25% APR.

We own two vehicles outright(1 car, 1 truck, maybe $20k combined), though we are likely to purchase a new vehicle($30-60k) in the next year or two.

We have no credit card, school, or medical debt.

We have a little over six months expenses in our emergency fund(traditional savings account at a bank).

We have about 3 months of expenses in different traditional checking &amp; savings accounts that we use to pay the credit card(all living expenses) and mortgage.

We currently pay about $1200/month for preschool.

We have about $10k in investments through Fidelity and Robinhood.

We have roughly $100k in various retirement accounts(3 401ks and a roth 401k). Some of these are at former employers.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term, we intend to accomplish these things:

&amp;#x200B;

Build a custom home locally($500k-1mil) within next 10 years

Buy rural land($100-500k) within next 10 years

Build homestead on above land(unfinished plans, unknown cost) within next 20 years

Help as needed with parents and siblings(late 50s, early 60s parents with no retirement funds. 2 low income siblings, one of which will have a child soon)

Help as needed with our child's education

Retirement

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I welcome advice for how to approach our interesting windfall and how to plan for accomplishing our goals. I am most unsure of the tax implications and best practices for such things long term.

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to talking with financial advisors, lawyers, etc, but it is difficult finding someone appropriate that doesn't want us to just pay them to invest for us. Even just help with search terms, titles, companies, w/e would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to provide more details of our circumstances if I happened to miss something relevant.

83,personalfinance,Thoughts on buying a 2nd home. Why or why not?,"Should I buy? Why or why not?

Hi all, 
So my wife and I bought a house back in December 2020 for $420k. We knew this house wasn’t going to be our forever home but we bought it because we didn’t want to keep renting and it’s in a great location in the Palm Springs area. Since we bought it, it’s gained over $100k in value in 9 months. 

Now, there’s a new development community being built later this year and we really want to purchase one. Existing homes in this area are going nuts and there’s bidding wars, as I’m sure in many parts of the country. There will be tons of new development being built around this community: more new single family homes, condos, expansion of a Cal State University, resorts, and a huge Arena that will host sport games and concerts, etc all within a 10 mile radius of this new development I want to buy. 

The home will cost about $750k (more if we decide to add a pool). 3 bedrooms/ 3 bath + casita. So In total 4 bed /4 bath and 2,600  sq ft home. My plan to is rent out our current home. Rents here are crazy expensive and after speaking with agents, they tell me I can get about $3,300/month on long term lease. My mortgage with PITI is $2,300 so it will more than cover expenses. 

On the new home, we plan to rent out the casita for at least $1,200/month. Im being conservative in the $1,200 because I tested out the market and posted on Nextdoor that I was renting out my casita. I had 4 people contact me and the lowest someone offered me was $1,500 per month. Someone was willing to pay $1,800. It’s insane - so that’s why I figured $1,200 is a good starting point. 

Finances
- Combined income: $170k 
- Stable jobs in healthcare 
- We’re both 25 years old 
- 1 baby 
- We contribute into our 401k and investment accounts 
- no debt 
- Will put 20% down on the home

Our mortgage payment will be about $3800 with an interest rate at 3% (rates are actually lower but being conservative with 3%) jumbo loan and $600k financed. I know this is basically going over our budget and we’re over leveraged. But considering that we will be renting out the casita for at-least $1,200, this would bring down our payment to at-least $2,600 if not more ($300 more than we’re already paying). I’m entertaining this idea because of how low interests are and the appreciation this house will get after build out and the expansion of all the other developments surrounding this house. Yes, the price of the home is crazy high, but the interest rate is insanely low! And property values will only increase in this area and there’s a bunch of new development happening. Homes near this development are exceeding the $1M price tags and Real Estate agents have told me this is a prime location. Not to mention, new construction homes are being rented out for over $6,000/month short term rentals and there’s a waitlist (note: they all have pools as that’s what renters are looking for). Also, if the values does significantly increase after build out, I can sell it and take my profit. Or keep it, take out a HELOC and buy more investment properties. 

I’ve spoken to an investor that has over 25 homes in the Palm Springs area and he gave me his perspective and told me: 
One of two things are going to happen, 1. In 5 years, you’re going to be extremely happy and grateful you bought this house 5 years ago because it’s worth $1M plus or 2. You’re going to purchase it and regret it because it’s now worth $500k.

84,personalfinance,Should I reduce monthly overhead or possibly take from investments over time?,"Situation: Currently in HCOL area and plan on staying here. Separating from the military and will be going to college for the BAH and staying home to take care of kids. Wife will be getting her BA the same time I get out, then will be job hunting. Currently making $470 a month payments on my car with 17k left. I have ~80k+ invested currently.  

I want as much stability as possible. With the unknown income (as in could be months before she gets a job) that my wife can possibly get and the guarenteed BAH that is enough to pay mortgage payment with $800 leftover (which goes towards phone bills, utilities, car insurance, etc). 

I'm debating paying off the car to reduce my monthly spending. Even though my cars interest is 5% vs ~10%+ made from investments. 

The issue is for an example, if we were to bring home $3k per month and end up spending $3300, It would be negative $300 every month which would be taken from investments. I could pay off my car and be positive $200 with the loss of money in investments. 

There is always the chance that wife lands a decent job and everything will be great but I don't like uncertainties and feel like I should reduce my monthly overhead as much as possible until money starts flowing again. I think the easiest big bill to lower is car payments and could also get my insurance lowered.

2,personalfinance,Medical expenses against capital gains in America,"I am Canadian and reasonably competent in Canadian tax issues, but I have to address an American tax issue and I want to verify that the results of my research makes sense to the American accountants here. 

My question is the following: am I correct in concluding that itemized medical expenses are deducted against a taxpayers adjusted gross total income, which would include current income and capital gains? 

For background: my American grandmother recently passed away and her executor (my American cousin) needs to file my grandmother's 2020 and 2021 tax returns, both of which we believe will result in a tax refund. 

My grandmother had significant medical expenses (about $50,000/year - $70,000/year) for her end of life care, which exceeded her modest income from a pension. To help cover these costs, she sold some of her capital assets. While she will have a capital gain in the year of the disposition to report, I am not sure whether I we can anticipate that her significant medical expenses can be used to offset the tax liability arising from that disposition. We will be retaining an accountant to handle the filing of her taxes, but I am trying to get a snapshot of the fiscal position of her estate and I have a blindspot in this discrete area. 

As well, I am proceeding on my conclusion that her nursing home fees are deductible as a medical expense. She was 100 years old and we would have no issues proving that her living there was medically necessary.

9,personalfinance,Credit card question... sort of unique?,"

Hi all.  So I have sort of a unique situation.  I currently have 2 credit cards, one through USAA and one through Chase (Amazon).  I *never* use the USAA card as I've moved on to a credit union instead, but it's my oldest account (~11 years), so I leave it open.  I use the Chase/Amazon card for pretty much everything I can for the cashback.

A couple days ago, I applied for the the Fidelity credit card because it's 2% cashback on *everything*, whereas the Amazon card is only 2% on restaurants and gas, and 1% on everything else.  My end-goal here is to just use my Amazon card for purchases on Amazon (5% back), and the Fidelity card on everything else instead, thereby basically doubling my cashback rewards that I get right now.

Soooo... all that being said:  I'm *also* looking at the Chase Sapphire Preferred card.  Right now, if I spend $1334 a month for 3 months after getting it, they give $1000 cashback ($1250 if used on travel!).  Is there any downside or anything wrong (besides maybe a hard inquiry) with getting this new Chase card... using it exclusively for &lt;3 months, pocketing that $1000, and canceling it right afterwards?

My current vehicle (the 05 Honda Accord) has the check engine light come on and off sporadically and I think the brakes are going to need to be replaced soon. I purchased the accord for cash at $3800 and have already replaced 2 tires and a O2 sensor on the vehicle.

17,personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy: Down to just under 50k mixed between Federal (31.6k @ 5.6%) and Private (18K @ 2.8). What to do when forbearance ends?,"Hello all,

Just looking for some advice on how I should move forward with paying for my loans, namely when the Covid forbearance is done in February.

Some facts about my loan journey so far:

- I'm 31, so I've basically been paying these loans for 10 years already and I want to be done with it

- Graduated from a crap school with a crap degree (got suckered by a for profit). In my early years out of college I was dirt poor and so my student loans hit a peak of somewhere in the 120k range whilst I was unemployed with the majority being private

- Eventually started making a little money but not enough to pay more than interest for years. I let one loan go into collections (approx 26k)

- Turned things around with a career switch and tons of refinancing. Continued to ignore loan in collections

- Saved money (around 16k) for settling with the loan in collections in case I got sued while I continued to ignore it. Never got sued and the loan ended up being dismissed. Big win. That money is now my emergency fund (but is 20k now)

- Currently I work two jobs. I make 107k from my main job and somewhere around 12k-13k a year from the secondary (it's a low stress job but I honestly don't want to do it anymore, I always dream about quitting)

- My credit has repaired from my past delinquency this year. It's been good for a while but right now it sits just above 800 (according to both Chase and Discover's score calc)

- Outside of that 20k fund, I don't have much savings or assets. Just a retirement fund that I probably don't give enough money to and some other small things. No real investments like in the stock markets and no mortgage or anything like that.

- Don't have kids nor do I plan to in the next few years. Yay for debt delaying my life :(. I have a girlfriend but I live alone and don't necessarily expect that to change soon.
 
- Right now all my money goes to the private loans. My regular automatic payment is $430, then I add the $370 I would be paying my federal, plus an additional $400 from my main job and the entirety of what I get from my second job which let's call $600 monthly on average. This sums up to about $1800 monthly at least. Sometimes if I just have excess cash I'll make another payment to my loans.

Given my circumstances, what should I do? Do I just keep paying down the private until it's gone, or should I start moving a little more aggressively on the federal to save on interest? Should I just refinance my private and take advantage of the lower interest rate? At what point should I stop paying my loans so aggressively and start moving more money towards savings and investments? Or should I only do that when I'm debt free. I'd love some advice on what I should be doing. These loans have stressed me out for basically all of my adult life and while I still have a long way to go there's at least light at the end of the tunnel for me.

So, I really feel like I want to transfer to this close branch, but my manager is hyping me up so hard for a promotion and has had two in depth conversations with me as to why I need to stay in her branch and that no other branch compares to hers (She does have the rep to back that up as her branch is the highest rated via surveys in the whole state). I also got a big pay raise recently that lines me up pretty much with what I would earn in the higher position, so I keep thinking as to why would I take on more responsibility if I’m already getting paid as much as the next position up? 

I would really love to work close to home. I’d love to have my weekends off again. I feel like it would balance my life out again with those two back to back days off. i’d be able to rest properly again. I just don’t know how to start the conversation for a third time up again without seeming like an indecisive idiot. I feel like she’s going to seem so annoyed.",1632411651

33,personalfinance,How to best prepare to buy a home,"So me and my partner got engaged and I got a promotion at work that (I'm hoping) will allow us to buy a home within the next 2 years or so. 

Here's our breakdown 

Me
Income- $55k
Car loan- $5k at 3% (payment is $166/mo but I over pay)
Student loans- $10k (all federal unsubsidized)
Savings- $21k in a high yield savings
Retirement- 3% in 401k (will probably increase but I just got the raise)

My partner
Income- $36k
No debt 
$20k in savings 
Retirement- maxed Roth IRA 

The problem is housing has doubled in cost in the past 5 years where I live. We live in a hot commodity place so the sooner we can buy the better (obviously it's bad everywhere but we live in the ""hottest zip code"" in the us). 

Our budget would have to be in the $280-310k range for a small house or townhome. This is kinda concerning because per the 3x rule we can only really afford $280, the lowest side of our budget, and I'm not banking on a crash where we live.  

Is this feasible? Best way to prepare? Is it better to pay down debt or boost savings? Should we start investing to boost our down payment? Or should we plan on moving to a cheaper place if we want to afford anything. 

Thanks in advance.",1632411158
34,personalfinance,Thinking of doing a chashout Refinance on my home and using the cash to pay off our vehicles. Good idea or not?,"Now, here's the logistics of it. We have lived in our home (Texas) since 2017, the original purchase price of our house was $200k, since then we have refinanced it one time (VA loan) because interest rates went down (3.24%). Well, due to the market being up right now, our house is now valued around $270k to $310k, and interest rates for VA loans has gone down to about 2.67%, so much beter. But the problem is Texas doesn't let you pull money out of government programs, so we would have to do t traditional/ conventional loan, interest would be 3.24% (what we are currently at) bit we would be able to do the cash out refinance and get about $40k which would effectively pay off one car (we owe about $25k on, and the remaining money, plus whats in my escrow account currently ($5k) would be put towards my other car, which I've had less than 6month and a remainder balance of $38k.

We don't plan on living in this house forever, maybe another 5 years maximum, so I'm wondering if its a smart choice since we qould only pay a lot more towards the cars/house if we stayed here the full term of the 30 year loan. Its also worth noting that I'm property tax exempt (veteran) so my payment won't go up much.

Also, the reason for doing this is to reduce our monthly spending.  Because our cars are $650 and $860 a month, and our mortgage is only $800/m.

35,personalfinance,Purchasing a Home with Parents as a Co-Borrower," Hi everyone, I’m a 23M who just recently started my first professional job. Since graduating, I moved back home to live with my parents - we live in a very VHCOL area (Washington DC/NoVA). We are a family of immigrants and have been renters in this area since we arrived. However, over the past couple of years, it has become apparent that we have outgrown the place we are currently living in because my parents put purchasing a home on hold to help me and my younger brother pay for college. 

My parents and I started discussing purchasing a home together – with them being the primary borrowers and me being a co-borrower. This is primarily due to my parents not being able to afford the type of home we are interested in solely on their income. With that said, the amount I would be paying to help with the mortgage is significantly less than renting with another person or on my own as rent prices are quite high in our area. I do want to say that I would prefer to live on my own if I were to rent, primarily because of not-so-great roommates in college and my friends in the area not being compatible roommates. I enjoy living with my parents and we see eye-to-eye on a lot of things. They gave up everything to restart their lives in this country and purchasing a home would essentially fulfill their American Dream and all the goals they set for themselves once they arrived here. 

My parents have made it clear though that the home will become mine once they retire and move back to our home country (they don’t care about the equity or profit made on the home, they just want to live under the same roof) – so in a way, they are helping me purchase this home which is why it’s appealing. Another reason why this is appealing is because over the next few years or so, I can see myself and many individuals from my generation being price out of homes in the area. From what I’ve researched and learned from our agent, the area we are in was somewhat resistant to the 2008 Real Estate crash. 

The past couple of days, I have been getting cold feet. While my parents did help me pay for a lot of my college, I do have $47K in federal student loan debt primarily from my graduate degree (this is the only outstanding debt I have – no car, no CC debt, etc.). So, with that lingering over my head and trying to get my finances in order, I have been concerned with how a mortgage will impact me down the line. My current job and salary are great for this area (and I foresee myself staying with this firm for a long time), and by the time my parents retire and move on (5 years or so), I will be able to comfortably afford this home on my own. It’s just been so hard navigating all this so soon after finishing school. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts and insights on my situation but please, when giving advice be considerate that I am from a different cultural background. The country where we are from is very much collective and putting family first is of utmost importance.

Additional Information: 

My parents have excellent credit and we’ve been pre-approved for way more than we need, and fully anticipate staying on the lower end of that budget. My parents are going to be putting 5% down on the home with no immediate out-of-pocket costs for me until we close on the home.",1632411058

I have a Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement 2050 Fund through Columbia University, which I stopped contributing to 7 years ago. Two years ago I lost 60% of my balance because I was only 40% vested. I recently received a letter from Vanguard saying that I needed to rollover the money in my account to a new one (not clear why, but whatever). When I started the rollover process on their website I saw that only 40% of my balance was being included in the rollover. I called Vanguard and they told me I was only 40% vested. I told them that they had already taken their 60% two years ago. After many phone calls to both Vanguard and Columbia, I was finally told that they ""missed"" a ""backend error"" and that I was in fact fully vested, and my full balance would roll over. I asked if they would send me an email explaining what had happened and they refused. 

I think it's worth mentioning that if I hadn't opened my mail and seen that I needed to start the rollover process, Vanguard would have done this for me automatically. And in that case, poof... 60% of my money would have been gone. I have no way of knowing how widespread this ""error"" is, or if it's more on Columbia or Vanguard,  but please, if you have a Vanguard retirement fund that you're not fully vested in, double check that they aren't trying to take their percentage more than once.",1632409843

The total deposit was 13,000 and I thought it was strange that they asked me to write down where I worked and what I did. The lady asked me why I didn't deposit it all at once and I explained I didn't want to bring in the whole shoebox and also thought it would be easier for them to not have to run the entire thing through the machine at one time. She informed that I had not made things easier.

48,personalfinance,Employee Stock Purchase at a Discount and Paying Taxes on that Discount,"Details adjusted slightly for anonymity.  My company offers an employee stock purchase where we can buy the stock at a discount (25%).  The price is set based on the NYSE value at closing June 1.  So the value June 1 is $10, we can buy the stock for $7.50, a discount of $2.50.  However, in order to pay taxes on this benefit, the stock value on July 1 is used.  July 1 the stock price is $12.50, so the benefit/discount to the employee is $5 per share.

Is this the correct way to do the accounting?  At first glance it seems wrong, but as I think about it, it makes sense that the company would have to wait until everyone decides how many shares they want before the company buys them from the open market or issues new ones.  When that action happens, the employee realizes the benefit and gets the stocks at that time (July 1).  A second question, if the value of the stock went to $5 on July 1 and we had paid $7.50 for it, how would that $2.50 ""loss"" be captured in taxes?",1632408797

* Say that I am interested in the position but also somehow mention casually I am mainly looking for positions with the higher title

65,personalfinance,"Qs about Emergency Savings v. Retirement Contributions for couple in their 30s, and when to start investing?","Just soliciting advice on this subject because technically my spouse and I are not following the flowchart.

Our ages are 33 and 38. We currently contribute 10% of our income (combined $180K pre-tax) towards retirement. Our employer is the federal government, so they match 3% fully and then 2% as a half match. So total contribution is 14%. Our plan is that, once each of us hits 40, we will slowly up our contributions (1% per year) until we are contributing 15% on our own, with 4% matching. Neither of us plans to retire until after 62, so we can collect full retirement benefits.

Technically, we only have 1 month's expenses in our savings (\~$6K). The flowchart says to save up 3-6 months before committing more than your employer's match amount to retirement. However, this makes us nervous because we are in our mid-to-late 30s. **Should we lower our retirement contributions and put more towards emergency savings until we hit at least $18,000? Or is it okay to keep our retirement contributions with the understanding that our emergency savings will take more time to build (we currently contribute $600/mo + whatever extra is left in our budget).**

Also, should we be investing? We do not currently invest (we had some bad financial habits in our 20s, so we have been focusing more on debt payment + building up retirement and savings up until now). **Should we wait until we build up 3-6 months savings before beginning to invest in mutual funds and ETFs, or should we start now with small sums (for example, just $10/week or $100/month?) and then up the sums once we hit our ES goal?**

Also, we have other pots of savings money - for example, saving for our next down payment, vacations, possible big expenditures for the home (furniture, repairs, etc). **Should we scrap all of these and just funnel money into the ES fund until we hit $18,000?**

Debt currently consists of a mortgage, student loans (we are on PSLF due to federal government positions), and $3500 on a 0% interest card (we have this on autopay and will be paid off before the 0% expires next year).",1632405877
66,personalfinance,Considering Refinancing and Need Advice,"I need some advise on whether this sounds like a solid plan. I will try to make this short and to the point.

**Cash Out - $10,000**

\*\***My plan is then to pay an extra $100 /month towards principal. I calculated this out with an Amortization Schedule Calculator and it is showing my estimated payoff date would be 7/22/2045.**

So if I am calculating this all correctly, I am basically getting $10,000 and it is going to cost me nothing to do it? I am fine with paying a little extra per month to get me back to roughly the same payoff date. Am I missing anything here? What am I not considering?

I know banks require the previous 2 years of tax returns which disqualified me once already when I attempted to refinance.    

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do?  Thank you very much!",1632405227

71,personalfinance,Collections agency won’t provide receipt,"I read the wiki but still have a few questions. 
I recently negotiated with the original creditor and was able to get a significant amount off the debt I owed removed. 

I called the collections agency and they provided me with the new balance. I paid it all off, in full. I went back and forth for 5 minutes asking for a receipt. The lady kept repeating that my banks balance statement would be a valid receipt. I asked many times if I could get confirmation from them (the collection agency) that I paid the debt, and she kept telling me they do not provide receipts and my bank account statement would do.

Is a copy of my bank statement a valid form of a receipt?

What’s the point of paying this in full if it’s still going to show on my credit?",1632405033
72,personalfinance,Maxing Out 401 (k) and Roth IRA Upon Starting Full-time,"Hello r/personalfinance, 

I start my career-job next week and have a quick question about retirement investing. My main question is one of strategy. I'm debating whether or not to invest literally all of my income this calendar year in my retirement accounts to take advantage of this window before the year rolls over. For context, I have about $40,000 in my own savings which constitutes my own personal savings and my college bank account (which was transferred to me upon graduation). I do have loans comparable to this amount, but I expect to repay the minimum (for now). 

Is it even a viable strategy to subsist off my savings for a few months while maxing out a Roth and putting the rest into my 401 (k)?

He and my mom definetly have worked hard but I think they may have screwed themselves out of medi-cal by selling the house. Now, they don't qualify as they rent a room in my brother's house but have 200K in the bank from the house. 


I did some research and found they can gift it and incurr a penalty period of 1month for every 10k . The loophole is to gift 9,999  per day so it gets rounded down to 0 and get no penalty period. 

I talked with an elder lawyer and he said it would cost about 12K to set up a medical trust and do the gift stacking.  

Seems kinda pricey and is 5% of his total cash, any guide out there to diy ?

My dad (67m) and I (37m) run a factory together where he has worked for over 40 years. He is ready to retire, but hasnt started collecting SSI yet. He told me he has 250K in a 401K and I suggested to him because of the volitility of the stock market, to move that into something safer that he can draw from and pay taxes on when he uses it. 

I have read a little about insurance policies that you can borrow from and still collect the interest of your premiums but I am not really familar with that whole thing.

I’ve been unemployed and on MassHealth (Medicaid) until now. Got a job, enrolling in their health insurance plan Oct 1. Their plan has no premium, but the copays for everything are high. Only an annual physical is covered. Visits are $40, $55 for a specialist. Prescription drugs are even more. 

I just found out having COVID last year left me with a deficiency for which I now need daily injections to supplement. I also see a therapist 1x/week, am on a med, and see a specialist for it monthly. 

My monthly income is $3321 for 9 months of the year, then $0 in summer. 
My expenses are estimated at $1095/month for 12 months of the year, so about 30% of my income while I’m working, and 100% of my income while I’m not. 

MA has a premium forgiveness plan for lower income earners. It does not cover copays. 

Making over $2147 disqualifies me for transitional assistance benefits. 

The out pocket max for my employer sponsored health insurance is $8550, which is 28% of my income.

6,personalfinance,I need to Buy a car and I'm wondering in this low-interest environment if I should take a car loan instead of paying cash and then put the cash into the market long-term. Advice?,"Hey there. So we have 25k cash sitting doing NOTHING in a savings account.  This is earmarked for a new car. I will probabally buy a used car costing around that or a new suv-type vehicle that is 35k or so and keep it for many years. I'm Curranty driving a 2006 suv that is breaking down and I need an SUV type vehicle for my family car.

I am starting to think it would be a better long-term play to take the 25k (or most of it) and put it in the market long-term in vanguard index total stock market where it will make (on average but not guaranteed) more than the loan percentage on a new or used car is. 

I did this with my mortgage: We refinanced back to a 30 instead of a 15  and took the extra amount we would be paying a month on the 15 (about 500 a month) and I dump it into the market for long-term growth.  I do this monthly and automatically as if our mortgage really is a 15 year and we ""have"" to pay that extra.  Meanwhile, I get the growth of 500 dollars that is (on average but not guaranteed), much better than my 3.00 percent mortgage. 

Is there any good reason not to do this with a car? Seems like I am missing out on a lot of interest compounding if I take that cash and dump it right into a depreciating asset, but I wanted to get your opinions. 

Some additional details:
1. Income in our family is fine, and if we needed more cash, we have plenty we can extract from one of our two business, or plenty of non-retirement stock we could get at if we needed.  

2.  That cash for the car has been sitting there for years doing nothing and I don't feel good about that. I love compounding.  (It was an Old account from spouse, they felt more comfortable with it sitting there years ago etc.) That's my primary motivation for asking the question.  

3.  We have 100k cash sitting in an account doing nothing for a down payment on a home in a few years. I hate that this money is ""doing nothing"" while we decide on where we can live in the next few years, so that's more motivation for me to ""make this car money work for me."" I know you aren't' supposed to throw money in the market you are gonna need in the next  years.  

Anyway, bah blah blah. I understand if we had no other cash or needed this 25k for an emergency fund I wouldn't put i tin the market. But, since this is ""Car money"" anyway, I am trying to see the best route here. 

Any advice would be appreciated! :)",1632395489

Together we have 5k in an emergency fund that we are currently trying to build to 20k (had it there, but switching jobs and medical bills knocked it down significantly).

We are on a current budget that has us saving $1000 every two weeks at minimum. With this plan, we expect to reach our 20k emergency fund around May 2022. Here is where it will get interesting… I am a current PharmD resident and will see a pay increase from 50k yearly stipend to ~120k (conservative estimate as I am actually on an administrative track that is likely to pay more than that to start). We currently live in an apartment but are planning for a house in the next 2-3 years. Our main goal is to get a large house in the current area we live in due to all of the medical job opportunities and our families living &lt; 2 hours away. As a PharmD and with her being a nurse, we qualify for multiple healthcare and advanced medical professional home loans that will offer no PMI and little to no money down on large loans upwards of 750k - $1 million.

My question is that outside of our 20k emergency fund plan, how much money should we have saved for our first home and how much of a home can we afford knowing that we are very happy with the area that we are living in and trying to be here long term? We have no kids and are currently in a two bedroom apartment that is more than enough space for us to continue to live in while we try and save more money as our expenses stay relatively fixed and my yearly take-home income will increase by ~2.5x.

A lot of this also linked to the fact that we're living through a pandemic.

Is there a way I can see if this is true?

There are a lot of numbers on the forms they gave me. Do I need to add up all the payments and compare it to a certain number (before interest) to see how much I actually paid in interest?

37,personalfinance,"Since 401Ks are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, wouldn't I be better off investing privately to take advantage of the capital gains tax, assuming it is lower?","Hello all:

I've just started a new job that offers a 401k plan.
I've been trying to learn about retirement planning for several hours since  but I'm still struggling with several questions.

If I am not mistaken, 401k withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. So both the principal investment and the gain is taxed as income after withdrawal. If I had invested that money privately, the principal would have been taxed as income, and the gain is taxed as capital gains.

I have the following questions:

* Is it possible to have a scenario in which the capital gains tax is LOWER than the income tax upon withdrawal, leading you to actually pay more tax on a 401k than on private investment?

* In such a case are the benefits of employer matching and decreasing your current tax bracket enough to offset that extra paid tax? Are there any other benefits?

* When 401k withdrawals are taxed as income, does that mean if I withdraw $100,000 in a single tax year, for example, that I get taxed as if I earned $100,000 that year?

* Why do financial guides assume that I will be in a lower tax bracket after retirement? Is this because I would presumably only be withdrawing enough to pay for living expenses, instead of earning a high salary?

38,personalfinance,"ADVICE?? I fell victim to a scam call, and now Wells Fargo won't help me get my money back","HELP!

Firstly, I KNOW, I know, my first mistake was making Wells Fargo my bank. I have never had a bad experience until now, which is why I stayed with them, but now I'm P'd-off.

As the title states, I fell victim to a scam when I was called by a ""fraudster banker"" from a Wells Fargo number (Wells Fargo caller ID, verified number) saying someone was trying to add themselves as a recipient to my account to wire transfer $2400.00, which would drain my account. I was asked for information like account number, PIN, birthdate, last 4 digits of SSN, etc., and I naïvely gave them the information, as I trusted that I speaking to a real banker. I have never dealt with this type of situation, I'm in my early 20s, so I had no idea I was giving away too much unnecessary information. They were sending me verification codes to my phone number from official Wells Fargo SMS messages. They told me they would have to initiate the transfer in order to open an investigation on the claim, so I basically OK'd it, because, like I said, I was naïve. They told me the ""investigation"" would be done in 2 days, gave me a fake claim number to check on the status later. I called back after the two days, and obviously they had no idea what I was talking about.

Ultimately, the rep I talked to opened a claim and denied it because I approved the transfer. I kept getting the run-around when I'd put in requests to have this rep call me back so we can talk the situation over again. Come to find out later though, this rep denied it after only using one of three attempts Wells Fargo gets to reverse it.

I have followed advice from other threads and filed a police report as well as a CFPB report, but that didn't help because that claim was closed too. 

I feel so dumb and desperate. Is there anything else I can do in my situation?",1632377609
41,personalfinance,"Should I pay off my low-interest mortgage in full, or refinance to an even lower rate?","We have $80,500 left on our 30-year fixed mortgage.  Home value is somewhere around $860,000, payments are $500/month at 56% principal/44% interest.  I want to reduce or eliminate the interest I’m paying out.  I’d like to know if it’s smarter to refinance to a 15-year mortgage or to pay off the home completely.  

I’ve read on other posts here that the prevailing wisdom is to refinance, but we have the ready cash to pay off, without hurting our investments or emergency savings. I have several CDs that are earning .60% that I would use.  But is it smarter to hold on to that cash instead, refinance to a 15-year mortgage at 2.75 to reduce the interest, and pay down additional principal in smaller amounts?  Is it worth going through the trouble of refinancing at all, and instead keep my current mortgage (at 3.875) and pay down the principal in large amounts, say $10K over a year or so?

The interest payments aren’t helping with our taxes any longer, so there’s no hit there.   
 Paying off in full is very attractive, to not have that payment every month and to save that interest cash.  But I can’t help but wonder if there’s some benefit financially in keeping the mortgage?  I have no head for math and can’t work out what would be the smartest option, or if there's an angle I'm missing.  Is there any benefit to holding on to a mortgage at all?  Is it smarter to keep the loan and invest that $80K elsewhere?  I’m curious to hear this group’s thinking on this.  Thanks for any insight you can share.",1632376112
42,personalfinance,Retirement questions from a late-ish retirement planner,"I’m 28, gross \~$60k/year, and have significant savings but have put off actual retirement planning until now (I know…) because I find it so incredibly confusing. I read through the relevant parts of the sub wiki—MASSIVE thank-you to everyone who put that together, it clarified so much for me!—but still have a few questions. If anyone here can give some advice or point me in the right direction, I'd very much appreciate it!

**I have the option of a 457(b) and 401(k) through work—do I just pick one?** I couldn’t find this addressed in the wiki. I work for the government and so have the option of a 457(b) or 401(k), but the 457(b) seems more attractive because it gives me more options for emergency withdrawal should an emergency arise, so I’m not really considering a 401(k). Would there be any benefit to having both?

**My employer doesn’t match retirement contributions: should I go with both an IRA AND a 457(b)?** I’m pretty sure the answer is “yes.”

In this situation, it seems that the only benefit of a 457(b) is the higher annual contribution cap, which does seem like a pretty significant benefit. Otherwise, the withdrawal restrictions, required minimum distributions, and fund limitations (I would keep things simple and stick with a target date fund so I don’t have to deal with picking and choosing asset allocation: it has an expense ratio of 0.43%—not terrible, but not great) are downsides.

Seems like I should max out both a 457(b) and IRA for a few years until I’ve (hopefully) backfilled what I should have been putting away previously, then switch to maxing out my IRA before putting the rest of my retirement savings into the 457(b). Does that sound right?

**Does Roth vs. after-tax impact contribution limits?** Another question I could neither find in the wiki nor on Google. I’m electing a Roth for my 457(b) and would like to go with a Roth IRA, as well: do the contribution limits remain the same regardless? I assume yes. I should probably just check with whatever institution I open the IRA with.

**How much should I be putting in retirement across accounts?** I know that 15% (some say 20%) is the general recommendation. If I have multiple types of retirement accounts is that 15% spread across both/all? (This is probably a dumb question with the answer being “Yes,” but I’m afraid of putting more money in retirement than necessary because of the withdrawal limitations.)",1632376050

44,personalfinance,Taxes from sports betting,"I’ve been betting on sports a lot lately without any real concern for taxes since I haven’t really made that much off it ~5K net profit.

So in my situation I’ve placed about 10K in bets and I have 15K in winnings. It sounds like if I were to take the standardized deduction of ~24K (married) the IRS would tax the entire 15K despite the fact that I’ve only really “won” 5K. 

Assuming all of that is correct, it sounds like it would be in my best interest to try to bet and “win” over ~24K. 

So another 14K in bets and around 10K in “winnings” since you can only deduct up to your winnings… Granted that’s a little easier said than done but doesn’t seem entirely impossible either. Is there something I’m overlooking here or is my logic and relative strategy on point?",1632374624

My best childhood friend is having an issue of needing to keep her family home in the country she's in, after an estate battle with family.

1. She lives in another country (one with very devalued currency compared to the USD, which is why this is easy for me)  
2. For obvious reasons, I have never transferred over large amounts of money internationally (this exceeds $10,000).  I'm quite unfamiliar with this and a bit afraid because of how understandably ""fishy"" this sort of thing looks to banks, but I'm a responsible client and have a good history.

53,personalfinance,Balance transfer vs personal loan,"I am in my late 20’s and I am working towards being debt free. I have a stable job making $48k gross income with guaranteed raises each year based off performance 3, 5, or 7%.  The last two years I have received 7% and 5% and on track to get another 5% this year. Over 4 credit cards I hold a balance of 17.3k.  My monthly payments combined are $506. I have been wanting to make a change in order to pay the debt down faster.  I do not use these cards any longer and am just looking to pay them off. 

I have been going back and forth between 2 options 

Option 1. Apply for a credit card that allows balance transfer with an introductory rate of interest free. The offers I have received say I will be paying ~22% interest after the introductory period of 18 months which is roughly the rates I’m paying now.  Why I have been hesitant to apply for this is I’m not sure what happens if I don’t get approved for the full amount. Is that still better than what I’m paying now or better than option 2? If I apply for this offer and I don’t get the amount I’m looking to transfer would I have been better off never applying due to the hard credit check which could in turn cause me to be declined for a personal loan. 

Option 2. Take a personal loan for the full amount. I have an offer for 14% interest on a 60 month term paying $415 per month.  Granted I still have the ability financially to pay what I have grown accustomed to paying which should allow me to pay the debt off sooner. This would be basically what I’m currently doing just at a lower rate and everything owed on 1 date instead of 4 payment dates which is actually a benefit. This option I feel is safer just because I’m not sure if I would be accepted for a 17k balance credit card but I feel more confident in acceptance for a loan of that amount. 

What do you think do I take the risk of applying for a balance transfer which could save me 18 months of interest on the balance approved for or do I take the safer route of the loan",1632371112

I’m just curious if a lower interest rate is really possible for me. My loan is currently about 6 percent interest, I’ve seen BofA offers refinancing loans as little as 3 percent. My credit score is a little over 770 via Chase app and was 680 or so when I initially got my loan over 2 years ago. So I don’t know if that would be good enough for them to give me around that 3%?

So basically tldr; is applying for refinancing worth it when your credit score increases by 100? Is getting a 3% interest loan possible? Is it a hassle to do or can it all be done via computer?

**My questions are:**

**1.) Given the funds above and the possibility of doing a mega backdoor Roth in the future (next 1-2 years), should I roll-over to an IRA or roll-over to the new company's 401k plan?**

**2.) Given the funds above, which should I invest in? Ideally I'd want a fund with 0% bonds but I have a feeling the Vanguard Target Retirement funds are the best option. I was thinking something like 40% FXAIX and 60% Vanguard 2065.**

**3.) Is the high 0.50% Recordkeeping and Administrative Fee too high to make investing in this 401k plan not worth it? It seems much higher than Vanguard's or Fidelity's, for example.**

69,personalfinance,Rebuilding Credit - Best Options?,"Hi all, 

I'm trying to rebuild my credit, but am finding it difficult. I had defaulted on some credit card payments and a loan a few years ago, and all the debt was bought by a company. The amount isn't much- total about $5200. I called the company that bought the debt, and they agreed to a payment plan and a total payment of about $3500, with the majority paid off in 6 months. But I have a few questions..

- If this company agreed to a lesser than full amount of the debt, once this is paid off, will this still be hurting my credit if it ""wasn't paid in full""?
- Credit card(s)- I can't get a traditional credit card right now due to this, but was reading about secured credit cards as a good way to help bring my score back up, and was looking at the Citi Secured MasterCard. Any other recommendations? 
- I've currently only made one payment to the debt company, will making these payments help my score, or just finally show me in good standing with these accounts?

Any other good ways to help raise the credit fast? I will be moving in a year when my current lease is up, and need to be able to get approved by an apartment complex (current place only took me because they were desperate for tenants during covid- I have not missed a payment with them in over 1.5 years with them)

So the $90,000 growth is tax-free when I take it out.  Vs if I would have put 10,000 pre-tax, saved $2,000 back then, but then have to pay tax on the $90,000 when I take this out?

76,personalfinance,"Inherited IRA, any reason not to take out the money this year before my income skyrockets?","Hi, all, here are the TL;DR facts:  


* Inherited an IRA in 2019 when my Father passed
* I graduated law school earlier this year, took the bar, and will start getting paid an Attorney salary some time in November.
* I am married filing jointly
* I took out some money previously, due to the birth of my son and costs associated with that event

&amp;#x200B;

It is my understanding that, because I took out some money previously, I now have to clear the IRA out by December of the 5th year following my father's death.

Because I was finishing law school this year and simply working as a clerk, this is certainly the last year my wife and I will be in the income tax bracket that we are; simply put, we are moving tax brackets when we file our 2022 taxes.

As of now, I intend to take the money out within the month, because I can see no reason to wait until next year, or the year after, to take the money out when I will certainly be taxed more on that ""income."" 

But, I am not experienced in this area, nor have I done all that much research, so I am open to hearing opinions on why I shouldn't withdraw the money, or be corrected if any of my assumptions are incorrect.

* Person 1 Salary: 205k with 20-30k bonus (lawyer, regional mid law firm so about 85-90% to big law market)
* Person 2: Salary 130k with 225k in yearly equity (works in tech) for at least 2.5 years. When this stabilizes (recent IPO, so a lot of equity grant is from appreciation), salary will likely be 150k and yearly equity will be around 75k.
* We assume our base salaries will increase 5-10% yearly.
* Our total post-tax monthly income hovers around $18,600 

Savings: $1,0015,000

* Roth IRA: 600k (not a typo, we've done well in the market)
* 401k: 15k 
* 30k cash - I realize this is low, we had a lot of big ticket expenses recently, no regrets.
* 370k liquid investments in non-tax advantaged accounts (almost all from equity compensation, almost all in the company's stock until we get to LTCG, at which point we will liquidate/diversify)

Three weeks ago, the A/C would randomly cut out (once after I was driving in stop and go rush hour traffic for an hour, and once when I had just started the car.)

So I took it back there, and they couldn't replicate the symptom for a week. One of their techs finally took it home overnight and replicated the symptom on the highway two weeks ago.

They started diagnosing the problem and took an entire week (something about going through every wire or something) and finally said it was the in car temperature sensor. That was replaced and cost another $205 (after another three weeks without a loaner/rental car.)

I picked up the car two days ago and immediately noticed the A/C was still cutting in and out. It would make a strange sound, like something was ""shifting"" whenever it did that (similar to the sound you hear when you switch between air vent selections.) I asked the manager to come out as a witness, but it turned cold and started working again... He said it takes time for the A/C to start working (which certainly wasn't the case prior to three months ago) and that they verified that it was working.

It cut out again on the way home, and started working again after I turned back towards the repair shop. It's super frustrating and I'm not sure what to do at this point.

Should I take it back to Ford Quicklane? What if they take another three weeks or even three months, and still can't permanently fix it? I won't have a car to use in the meantime, and have to incur additional transportation costs.

Should dispute it with my credit cards? Do I dispute only the $3,000 or the $205 or both? Do I have a reasonable case for either?

Should I do something else? or am I out of luck? =\\

My biggest catch is that it’s really more than I’m ready to pay for… not by too much, maybe like 4K over. I know that this is like the worst time ever to buy something used that’s worth anything. I will trade in my current car, but it is a bit of a shitbox - very reliable but very rough. I’m looking at a new vehicle because I live a truck lifestyle (hunt, fish, dirt roads), but currently drive a Honda Civic, therefore it often keeps me from doing things I’d like to do. Also its a bit of a shitbox, 2008 with 130k miles, front bumper is held on with zip ties, is healthy but extremely basic especially for the things I’d like to do.

Enough background - I’m curious who on here out a car that was on the fringe of their range, or maybe beyond it, and how it worked out? As it works now, I am able to put about 1k (give or take) into savings each month, but with this truck that’ll turn into about 600. I straight up don’t like that. Some friends are telling me to treat myself and some are saying to wait or go with less. I’m a big saver, so I’m leaning towards balking, but the truck is legit, I do need a vehicle soon and it fits every want and need. 

Willing to listen to all- thanks in advance!",1632355909

13,personalfinance,When does bank of america close accounts for overdrafts?,"I have an account balance that's been at around -179 ever since the 26th I believe of last month, for just a quick context on what happened here: I have a pretty bad instance of bipolar type 1 and had a nasty little manic episode where I quit my job entirely, let my account go into the red and up until honestly just a few weeks ago was living off the streets doing god knows what. I've gotten myself back on my treatment and got another job everything but having my checking account go away would be a blow to me getting my stuff back in order as I don't have a mailing address as of right now so I can't just sign up for chime in the immediate future and then I'd have to potentially deal with chex systems if I wanted to sign up for another account and all that.  


I'm gonna be giving them a call tomorrow to see what they say while I wait for this job I just got to get me on the schedule and for my first paycheck to arrive in probably two weeks, I'm not expecting anything positive from that call but I'm hoping that the statement ""they'd rather work with someone than close an account"" rings true but if anyone has experience with bank of America in particular and knows when they actually will go about closing an account, that would be very useful.

And haven’t been able to do anything to increase it. I now need a loan of at least $2500 to cover the cost after insurance. But due to the fact that my credit is poor (570’s) and I have no verifiable income I haven’t been able to get any of the loans I’ve applied for.

18,personalfinance,Is there anyway to get car repo off credit that I was never notified about?,"About 3 years ago I co-signed on a friend on a car loan (side note: I already know it was bad idea,  I was younger at the time didn’t know much about credit at the time but I was looking for ways to raise my credit score so when she asked I was like okay) she was a couple years younger than me didn’t have any credit and someone had co-signed for me on a car when I was younger and and I paid it back no problem so I didn’t see an issue helping someone else out. She had a full time job and the payments were only like $250 a month. 

The first year she paid the car off every month on time no problem actually helped my credit get up to like a 740 score and even was able to buy my first home last year. 

But then the beginning of this year for several reasons we actually stopped being friends we were not in any type of communication at all. I notice that she started paying late all the time and missing payments every month and I would keep getting letters and calls from the bank telling me that the payment were late and that I had to pay etc.. I knew that as a co-signer that was my responsibility but I didn’t know why she was not paying or what was going on with her

So I confront her about the car payments and she said the car was having problems and she was spending so much money on repairs that she forgot about paying the car note. I tell her i don’t care you need to you need to pay it on time every month I don’t need my credit affected because of you and I started to remind her every month to pay it on time. 

But even with me reminding her every month she and still pays late and/or misses payments and I continue to get letter and calls from the bank. So I start looking up ways to get off the car loan even telling her to sell the car or get another loan possibly but she ignores all my messages. 

Eventually the car gets repossessed and I had no idea I only found out when she was on Facebook asking people where she can find good car deals. So I called the bank myself and they told me they repossessed the car a week ago due to lack of payment. 

I was so blindsided I didn’t get any notifications or warnings that’s it was being repossessed she never told me that they were going to take it. So I didn’t get a chance to even try to pay to what was needed to stop the car from being taken. So of course my credit has subsequently dropped significantly. All the way down to 540 because of all this. 

I want to see if there’s anyway to get this off my report I’m trying to buy a new car soon and this is really affecting my ability to get a loan. I already got rejected for a loan at one bank even  using my mom as a co-signer even tho she has great credit and I have a solid steady income and a good amount for a down payment 

Any credit repair companies you can suggest that can help me dispute that or any other general suggestions you have get that charge off my report and help me raise my credit score again ? 


Tl;dr: co-signed for a friend a couple years ago on a car loan. the car got repossessed 2 months ago without my knowledge and my credit score has  dropped like crazy and it’s affecting my ability to get a car loan for myself.

23,personalfinance,"I'm in transition between insurance plans, but I have medical needs NOW(ish)!","Within the past month, I started a new job. I signed up for the health plan, and *I received a text message from Kaiser saying that I am covered as of 09/01/2021. However, I currently cannot access care*. I have not received my card. When I try to set up an account on their online portal, they claim I am not in the system. When I try to do anything else through the portal (including contact customer service) it tells me to create an account or call the number on the member card I don't have. I finally found a contact number and got my old membership record number (I had kaiser previously) from the customer service rep. She said she activated it, and that if I really am sure I'm covered I can make appointments now and they will take me at my word. I'm still not able to access the online portal or create an account. Hopefully the system just needs a bit of time to process and I'll be able to use the website tomorrow. Or the next day, or...

My medicaid coverage was supposed to run out the last day of August. I did not bother to apply for renewal or update my income information, because my new monthly income exceeds the threshold. About a week ago, (AFTER signing up for kaiser) I received a message that my medicaid coverage has been extended anyway, based on what I put in last year. So my medicaid works, but will probably be rescinded (retroactively?) as soon as I update my income information. My kaiser coverage may theoretically start working any day now. Maybe.

In the meantime, I'm almost out of 2 medications, and I need to see a doctor to re-prescribe both (and yes, Kaiser and medicaid DO have different preferred brands, thank you for asking). The medications aren't life-or-death, but going off them WILL put me in a more precarious position, and impair my ability to navigate this mess. 

Oh, and I might have COVID. I had extensive contact with an infected person on Friday. I went ahead and got a PCR at CVS the day I found out (Monday) and decided to just deal with any insurance bullshit later (which i'm really hoping won't bite me in the ass). It was negative, but now I've got a grab bag of symptoms that *could* be Covid, but could also be a cold, the change in weather, allergies, etc.  Seeing as you can test negative in the first days of an infection, I think I should probably get a second test before going back to the office.

In short, I need to schedule some doctors appointments ASAP, and I don't know where I can to receive care covered by my insurance. My options are:

* wait patiently for kaiser to send my card/ put me in their system (bad idea, at this point)
* keep using medicaid and hope kaiser will reimburse me if medicaid gets mad about it
* try to move forward setting up my care with kaiser when I have to do everything by phone during my lunch breaks.

I *like* option 2 best- it seems like the shortest route to getting my prescriptions refilled and my nose swabbed (it's also slightly cheaper). Kaiser also (according to the brochure) has a thing where they will let you continue using your old provider during the first few weeks of coverage. But I am very concerned about ending up in a situation where medicaid won't cover my old doctor because I SHOULD have been using kaiser, and kaiser won't cover me because I did not work it out with them beforehand. Is there a way to work things out with both to prevent this outcome?

**TLDR: I need medical care. I'm still covered by medicaid, but I no longer qualify. The new insurance I *should* be using hasn't processed me in their system yet. Can I keep using medicaid? Do I show up at a Kaiser and refuse to leave until they schedule me an appointment? How the hell do I navigate this?**",1632353406

I’m pretty sick of the cycle of buying cheaper cars in full and them shitting on me within a couple years, so my goal is to save around 10k and finance the rest of the cost of a pretty reliable car (newer and around 15-20k at most). 

I make a pretty good and decent amount of money, but I just started putting money in my account this past month. I can make even more than I do currently if I work more, and I have been due to this. 

- I’m a contracted worker, so there’s no pay stubs. 
- Last year was entirely unemployment and a shitty retail job due to the pandemic so I’m unable to use tax documents as proof of income 
- I just started putting money in my bank account.
- My FICO is currently at 720 

My ‘plan’ just from researching myself is 

- Save around 10k just for the down payment.
- Request a document from my management at the club clarifying my employment.
- Put a steady amount of money in my bank account for the next 3 months to further verify income. 
- Apply for a car loan in either Nov/Dec and hope for the best.

47,personalfinance,Hospital/insurance billed my mother over $3.5k for an ER visit. How to reduce bill?,"Hospital/insurance billed my mother over $3.5k for an ER visit. How to reduce bill?

My 67 year old mother had a BP spike to 200 last month so I called 911 and had her rush to the hospital where they monitored her for a couple hours, did some tests, gave a BP pill, and sent her back home. 

Later, she received an initial bill of $2.5k ($3100 before insurance discount) but since the policy has a $5k deductible, insurance won’t cover any of the $2.5k until the yearly deductible is met. 

I spoke to the hospital’s billing dept to see if they could do anything. Besides a payment plan that would still require her to pay the full amount, they said they would mail a financial assistance form (haven’t received yet) to evaluate for any eligible waiver.

Now this week, they received two more bills, one from the fire dept for $542 for the ambulance service they used to get to ER (my father’s car had broken down) and an additional $482 for “physician services” at the ER (which was $1544 before the insurance in-network) discount. 

1) My father (65) has a $90k income job so would they really qualify for any financial assistance through the hospital? 

2) Would filing an “appeal” with the insurance co make any difference? Asking because their policy has a $5k deductible so until that’s met, they won’t pay anything. So would an appeal “for a waiver” do anything in this case?

3) While we’re awaiting the hospital’s finance assistance form, I’m just curious if there is anything else we can do about it?

Although my father currently has a well-paying job, he is about to retire next year and their only income would be SS payments and they have barely $100-200k in retirement savings and $2k in monthly expenses including rent. So $4k is a big amount to them.

I'm constantly adjusting to see where I can move money into other budget lines (spend less on clothes, more on food, etc). 

I'm sitting at some couple thousand on my personal CC that's been sitting there for a few years, due to massive misfortune after I graduated which left me homeless for a few months. I've been trying to pay it off. The balance just kind of sits there. I do my best with my budget to allocate *at minimum* interest+50 or so bucks, though I'm not making a big dent. The card's APR is 22.99% which stresses me out. I currently do not use it, just trying to pay it off.

I have an option to take out a personal loan at 10-15% interest, pay off my credit card immediately, and then sit at the lower interest rate for a while.

Realistically I could not take it, and just try to keep hacking away at the debt. The lower interest and predictable monthly payment would definitely be nice though.

54,personalfinance,Need advice on a pricy house,"Update:  Ok I am desperate for answers so I have decided to add more info: salary yearly: 267 k . Mortgage : 4800 (including HOA , property tax and everything) . Price of house is 1.15 million dollars. Down payment 250k 

I really like a house that is worth 1 million dollars. I want to buy it but don’t want to be house poor at the same time. So if I exclude monthly rent, HOA, property tax as well as other necessary bills like average monthly credit card bill, son’s daycare, water bill, electricity, I will be left with 3268 $ monthly saving. 
I would also like to add that after down payments my emergency saving funds would have around 30 k (not including my 401 k that’s separate) 

Do you think with that monthly saving left in my account, is it a good idea to buy costly house? Can I afford it? I’d like to add that I have a wife and two children. 

Please suggest. Thank you!!",1632346570
57,personalfinance,Is buying house in our best interest?,"Myself and my fiance live in an area where rent for a 2 bedroom apartment has sky rocketed in the last 2 or so years. We both live with family atm but really want to get a place together. We kind of need either a 2 bedroom or very large 1 bedroom apartment, but prices have nearly doubled in the last few years. 

We bounced around the idea of buying a smaller house bc A)we get more privacy and B)it will cost less monthly.

I make about 2.4k a month and she makes about 2k a month. My monthly expenses are $380 for my car loan, $180 for insurance and say $500 for all my other small bills and loans. She pays $90 a month for insurance and $40 a month for her phone. And she said $150 in other bills. 

We have around 5k in savings. And are selling a lot of our belongings to save up extra for a down payment/ assets. 

I'm just having doubts that maybe buying a house isn't the right move? 

Most of the apartments we've found close to where we work are around 1200-1400 USD not normally including anything but water. Add internet, electric, propane or gas heating and I would guess thats another $200-250 for the both of us.

As for the houses and budget we have, if we kept it under 220k we would be spending 1000-1100 for the mortgage, then add the utilities. I have already started and been quoted at most 270k, but I would not want to go that high. We have been looking at houses closer to the 200k range.  

I guess my small list of questions for anyone would be 1) is the around $100-300 in savings a month worth the hassle? 2)are there any major things im missing in costs?",1632345937
58,personalfinance,How do I ask for more money and a different role at my company?,"I am an engineer in California and am pretty underpaid compared to other roles similar to mine. I don’t have much professional experience (only 1 year), but I do know that my title can get more money elsewhere. I can’t really move too far though due to family and my wife’s job. 

I have my one year review coming up at the end of the month and will have the opportunity for a raise. The position I’m in was invented for me when I was hired and I do believe I have done a good job at it despite the lack of direction from management. The thing is, however, I don’t like this position at all. It’s mainly data entry and not a lot of work that makes me feel accomplished. There are roles within the company that I think I would enjoy much more, but I am the only engineer in my department, so I can’t leave without getting a replacement. 

I would like to ask for a substantial raise due to market demand for my position, but I feel like if I get the raise, I will need to stay in this position to justify it. I would like the raise to match what I think is fair for my title and the work I have accomplished, but I also want to change positions. 

Should I wait it out after my review and raise then ask to transfer, or should I put it all out there come review time?",1632345320
60,personalfinance,Is moving because of housing costs a valid reason to relocate?,"Hey everyone.

I’ve been getting anxiety over the housing crisis the past few years. It seems housing keeps going up and up and I’m worried that I’m never going to be able to afford a house if I wait too long to buy.

People always say to never FOMO into the market but, Im looking at countries outside the US like Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, and those countries have severe housing crises’ that haven’t even shown any sign of abating. This has already reached the continental US, and Is seeping into the interior. I’m worried that if I don’t move to an undervalued market now, and purchase something, in a few years it’ll be too late and I’ll be a renter all my life.

The reason why I’m bringing this up is that I had a windfall of about 40k, which I estimate is enough for a down payment on an apartment/ small house in a city like Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, etc. I’m wondering if it’s worth it to try and make the leap to one of these places, even though I know no one there, in order to get financially ahead. I’ve visited them both before- I like them. I could see myself being happy there even if it means starting over.

But I’m just wondering if I’m panicking over nothing or if my concerns are real. I don’t know if I wait, that I’ll be waiting for a correction that never comes. :/

About me: 24, have a committed partner, live in Orlando, most family is in Chicago, little roots anywhere else. I’m working customer service, attempting to break into entry level IT.

Considering the following cities: Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Cleveland.

61,personalfinance,What the hell do I do now?,"Hey everyone...

I'm in the process of going through a divorce, and dealing all the tumult and chaos that brings with it. As part of the divorce we have decided to sell the home we bought together and to split whatever profits we get 50/50. We got very lucky and bought before the big market spike, so we are each looking at coming away with $100k or more.

I grew up pretty poor, I'm in an alright financial situation now job wise, but I still won't be able to afford a new house in our area for quite some time (if ever), so I'm not planning on using that money for that. I have never invested, barely got a 401k, hadn't had a savings account until very recently, all this to say, I have no idea how best to use this money to help me out later in life.

62,personalfinance,Lost car lease agreement,My wife is currently leasing a vehicle that has an end date of 12/23. I wanted to review her lease agreement to see if it might be worth us buying then selling. I asked my wife where she put the agreement and apparently it is lost... She has reached out to the dealership several times asking for the agreement and they keep giving her a BS story about how they cannot find it and she should just come it to talk about her next car. They know exactly what we're doing. I called today and asked them to send the agreement and they sent me a photograph of her agreement from the car she leased back in 2017. Needless to say I'm very frustrated with the dealership and my wife's organizational skills. Is there another way to get a copy of the agreement? Would that be available anywhere online or through the bank?,1632343795
64,personalfinance,PNC credit card fraud - constant denied transactions. Help?,"I have had a PNC credit card for a few years now. I have alerts set up in my account so I receive text message notifications for any transaction on my card (even denied ones). Starting in early August of this year, I started to receive alerts for denied fraudulent transactions on my card for a very small amounts. I contacted PNC and in which they closed my current card and issued me a new one. In the past 6 to 7 weeks I have received four new credit cards because every time I get a new one and have the alerts set up, I eventually get a notification that there is a fraudulent denied transaction. I am so confused at this point why this is still happening. Is anybody else experiencing this issue? Is it even worth it at this point to continue holding an account with PNC for credit card services?

71,personalfinance,What are the steps involved with getting a home equity loan?,"I'm a disabled US Navy veteran living on my Social Security only. I got a 100% VA loan to buy a condo. My problem is the HOA!

My regular HOA payment is $387/mo and my mortgage payment is $632/mo.

I can handle that okay each month on my Social Security income of $2000/mo. However, now I have been hit with a HOA Special Assessment of $482/mo. for 6 months. We condo owners are paying for a new roof OF ANOTHER BUILDING but that's just a fun fact now.

So I'm here asking for information and experiences regarding home equity loans. I'm hoping that will allow me to pay off the HOA Special Assessment (I get a 10% discount if the full amount of $2892 is paid by October 31) and to spread out my payments, possibly for a year or two.

I thought I'd be able to join a credit union and get a consolidation loan. But it seems that I'd have to be a member for a year first. 

I also considered refinancing but that's a long, drawn out and painful process. So I'm asking, is a home equity loan any easier than refinancing?

My local hospital system has started estimating what my patient portion will and they make me pay my portion of the deductible in advance of even billing my insurance company. They refuse to provide care unless I fork over the payment.

I don’t like this. I don’t like paying some portion of deductible without an EOB. How do I even know they will bill insurance. If they don’t, my payment will not be applied to the deductible. Also, I have other medical bills in-flight. By the time one gets to my insurance I may no longer even have a deductible to meet.

This is “Dignity Health” system policy. Make the patient pay their deductible prior to even billing the insurance. Withholding care unless payment is received. It feels wrong. Does anyone have any experience with this and recommendations on how to make them bill my insurance prior to requiring payment?",1632339572

76,personalfinance,Dad died unexpectedly a couple of weeks ago. Cremation and funeral are done. Looking for advice on next steps regarding his estate.,"I know similar questions are asked frequently, but I couldn't exactly find what I was looking for. My Parents were divorced. He was 62 and began collecting SS earlier this year. He had no will, or estate attorney/executor, or basically anything prepared in the event of his death. He was a veteran with 4 years of service in the Marine Corps and he worked 2 slow shifts a week as a pizza delivery driver. He had very few assets/possessions. His cremation was right at $1k. He had car worth maybe $3.5k but still owes his sister $2700 on it or so, minimal money in his bank account (less than $200, maybe now has a few more hundred with his final two paychecks.), a TV, an xBox, a handful of low cost kitchen items, a blow up mattress, and some clothes.   


We just obtained a few copies of his death certificates, and from what I've found, will likely need more. But right now my next step is a visit to his bank with a copy to see if he has a beneficiary listed. With no beneficiary listed they said we'd need an order from probate court to disburse the funds. How do I handle getting his car transferred from his name to mine so I can sell it? Will that have to go to probate court as well? In order to get things moving in probate court, do I need an attorney? Or can I do that on my own. Right now his bank account is frozen, with nothing able to be paid out. Only remaining deposits can go through. But what about his bills? Do I need to contact everyone (internet, phone, electric, etc) to let them know he's now deceased? Or can I just let any of those things go and not worry about it?

&amp;#x200B;

To top it off, we just found out he had been seeing his ex again, who had a hand in destroying our relationship with him about 10 years back. And she's claiming she was having her Unemployment payments direct deposited into his account, and she had one final deposit to go through. Albeit very odd, this does seem like it is actually the truth. However I'm going to make her show proof before we even consider paying her that money, but I'm wondering with probate court if it will even be possible to get the full amount to her with proof or not. Since my understanding is that his debts will be paid first before any money comes our way, and then we'll only get what remains after the fact. Or would that be a legal debt that is included in the others?

78,personalfinance,Cost of a coffee a day - is it really worth it?,"I've seen a lot on Twitter lately about people saying ""if you want to splurge on your coffees every day, then go for it! It won't make or break you"".

While that's true, I think you should put some numbers to it to fully understand what you're giving up by buying that coffee on a daily basis. Not only that, I get the feeling that individuals who buy coffee everyday are also spending more money on lunches/eating out which is a snowball effect.

Let's say you buy a $5 coffee per day, which you could instead get at work for free. You work \~5/7 days a week which means you're spending \~$1,300 on coffee per year. What does that mean for your retirement? Well, let's say you're 25, and you want to retire at 65. If you invested that $1,300 every year instead of buying coffee, **you would save an extra $366,000** (nominal, $166k in today's dollars) assuming an 8% return.

Now, let's say you also eat out for lunch 3 times a week, and dinner 2 times a week. Your net extra spend is $10/meal for lunch, and $15 for dinner (net extra spend meaning cost to buy food less cost to prepare at home). If you instead brought a lunch every day/didn't eat out for dinner twice a week, **you would save an additional $880,000** (nominal, $400k in today's dollars).

Bringing it altogether, **if you avoided these three habits, at 65 you would have an extra $1.25 million** ($570k in today's dollars).

Now, I think being too frugal is certainly a detriment and it's fine to treat yourself on occasion. However, I think you should also be aware of what you are depriving future you of at the same time.",1632338660
79,personalfinance,Soon to be debt free but with a bad credit score--how will this affect my application for a mortgage?,"Hi all,

My husband (29) and I (27) are nearly debt free, paying off \~150k of student loans and cars in the last 3 years. I a make 60k and my husband makes 76k before tax. Our side hustles bring in about 2k extra a month give or take (server, uber eats, babysitting, you name it)

Some further backstory--I have never had a credit card. I knew I needed one to build credit, but I just never did it. I just lived on what I made working. Fast forward, I graduate college with nearly 80k in student debt. Some missed payments in the early days left me with something like a 650 credit score at best.

Two years ago my now husband and I got serious about paying off our debt. We started slowly at first, but after March of 2020 we really kicked it up and on average pay 6-7k a month to debt (disclaimer, we are blessed with a unique living situation, renting a trailer at $500 a month combined). Since paying off sallie mae however, my credit score is now 620 and dropping.

My husband has a credit score \~800, but i'm sure it will drop some once we get to paying of the rest of his loans.

I feel so proud of us for paying off this debt, and for the financial success we feel set up for because of the lessons we have learned, but my question is, are we screwed when we go to apply for a mortgage because of my shit score?

We should be debt free in March 2022, and will have \~40k downpayment by September.

I have enough money  for 5% down, so conventional is a possibility, and the USDA loan really feels like a sales pitch from how excited the loan officer gets when they talk about it.

I have excellent credit, functionally no debt (CC paid off every month). Does anyone have any helpful tools that I could use to better compare the potential costs?",1632337051

I just don't have the opportunity to do so very often as I don't have anyone around me with a license that's willing to let me drive.
A family friend passed away and left me his truck, a 1998 Chevy Silverado. I got fresh tags, got it in my name and had to buy a new battery. Last time I drove it the person in the passenger side with a license told me it sounds like it's running really rough and should be looked at. On top of that, because I am not able to drive.much, the battery is dead. I made sure to start it once a week and leave it running awhile, but that didn't seem to help. I think something's draining the battery. But even still, being that it's so old and the state of the world with the whole pandemic, I'm wondering if I should just save up and get a used car that's in better condition and more up to date. As far as I know, the DMV here still requires me to do third party drive testing, and my truck is so different handling wise to a car. I know, because I paid for a driving instructor last year and drove a 2008 ford car and I had to readjust every week to how quick it moved.

8,personalfinance,What is a Triple Tax-Advantaged Account Worth?,"This is ultimately a post about choosing the right health insurance given high prescription drug costs.

I (31M, USA) have recently been prescribed an eye drop by my Ophthalmologist for a chronic dry-eye condition. This new medication increases my yearly prescription budget almost %2,000 (not a typo). I’ve gone through all the stages of shock, refused the medication, gotten a second opinion, reached out to the drug company, etc. Ultimately, I think my health is important and I’ve come to the understanding that, medically, this could prevent damage to my cornea and prolong healthy eyes. 

I currently have an HSA plan. I pay my meager medical bills and (until now) prescription drug costs out-of-pocket and max out the HSA as an investment vehicle. Thankfully, I have good health insurance through my employer, but this guarantees that I’ll hit my deductible under an HSA.

Some numbers:

Deductible: $2000

Company HSA Contribution: $500

Premium: $949.2/year

Drug Costs: %100 out-of-pocket until deductible is met, then $60/30 day

I max out all tax-advantaged accounts + contribute to a taxable brokerage.

This has caused me to re-evaluate my medical plans to make sure I’m making the right decisions. My biggest concern has been losing access to the HSA as an investment vehicle. I am married but switching over to my spouse’s plan ends up costing significantly more money no matter how you slice it, and we both have great insurance.

Here’s the bottom line: The HSA plan costs me $3000/year + $3,100 in HSA contributions (max minus employer contributions) for a total of $6,100. The traditional costs $1950/year. Both totals include drug costs. Obviously, I will want to invest the $3,600 I would normally put in an HSA, so the traditional + new investments = $5,550, for a difference of $550. 

Is $550/year worth the cost to stay in a triple tax-advantaged account, or would that $550/year be better invested in a taxable brokerage?

**Some back of the envelope math would suggest an HSA is worth $3100/year over a taxable:**

HSA = 3600\*((1+0.055)\^30-1)/0.055\*1 = $260,767

Taxable = 3600\*((1+0.05)\^30-1)/0.05\*0.7 = $167,426

Assumptions: 0.055 vs 0.5 since growth is not taxed and 1 vs. 0.7 since withdrawals aren’t taxed. (HSA – Taxable)/30 = \~3,100/year. 3600 vs 3600 but no HSA means that 3600 is post tax!

What are your thoughts on my math? Is an HSA worth 3100/year? What am I missing? How much is an HSA really worth and when should I move to a traditional?",1632334384

My identity was used to take out some massive loans a few years ago, and I subsequently put out a fraud alert on my credit. Any time I apply for credit, my app gets flagged and they have to follow up by calling me at my listed phone number to confirm it's me.

I applied for a credit card via chase last week, and predictably, no decision could be made. A few days later I get a voicemail from Chase asking me to call them back to verify myself. Nothing suspicious yet.

I call them back at their number. Immediately things seem weird because they're asking me for my credit card # to verify who I am (I'm applying for a new card, so I don't have a number). I thought it was strange they didn't realize that. Then they asked for my social, which I provided.

They then transfer me to another person. This person sounds like they're calling from some sketchy call center. Voices in the background, poor English, and their connection is breaking up a ton. I can barely understand her and had to have her repeat things numerous times. What I found to be such a poor decision on their part, however, is the fact that they send you a code to your phone that they ask you to recite back to verify yourself. Basically, exactly what every scammer in the universe tries to trick you into doing. WHY WOULD CHASE MAKE THIS THEIR PROTOCOL FOR VERIFYING YOURSELF?! All they're doing is teaching people that it's okay to give out codes sent to your phone to other people. A little consistency here would be nice.

I immediately hung up on the person, suspecting a scam. I then called Chase back through their app, and eventually came back to the same dept - still had a super bad connection that I could barely understand, in a loud call center, and asking for my one time code sent to my phone.

Until the card arrived a few days later, I was still wondering if I was being scammed. Even after calling directly from their app. That's how sketchy their process is and how similar it felt to someone trying to scam you.",1632332588

26,personalfinance,Walked away from a car purchase deal. What have I missed? What do I need to do?,"Last Thursday, I went and checked out a used car I intended to purchase from a dealership in South Florida. Test drove the car, worked out a price, was overall pretty happy with what I was getting. I ended up putting down 3000$ on a debit card and filling out the paperwork for a loan from Chase for the rest. As I was doing the paperwork for this, the service portion of the dealership went back to change the oil/filters and detail the car (it had just come in from a trade).


Well fast forward to me driving off in my newish car, and 2 miles from the dealership the engine quits and theres a cloud of smoke behind the car. I get over to the side of the road, call a tow truck and have it brought back to the dealer. I know a little bit about spinning wrenches, and it looks like they WAY overfilled the oil. Probably gallons over the maximum (the oil was about 6"" too high on the dipstick). There was oil coming from the intake tube of the turbo and seeping from the back of the engine. Car gets returned to the dealer and they say, ""no problem! its under warranty, heres a loaner car! we will try and find a replacement turbo ASAP. Could take a few weeks"" Well, this is simply unacceptable as I have to leave to head up north for military service in a few days. Of course, its an ""as-is"" sale on a used car, but I immediately want out of this since I need reliable wheels now. Management offered to upsell me on a newer car and I decline. The salesman I worked with told me that I could just walk away and call my bank (to dispute/get the deposit back) and Chase (to cancel the loan and not pay the dealership).  I decide the best thing to do is just to leave the dealership as they have refused to be reasonable with me.


Now, I know that I signed all the paperwork and technically I have no grounds to back out of the deal. However, the salesman called me later that night and says I have nothing to worry about and they have relisted the car for sale. I am pursuing my downpayment thru the bank dispute system, however I have been unable to get Chase to aknowledge anything as far as having a loan on file for me.

28,personalfinance,401k to IRA for disbursement,"So I posted this on the Fire subreddit and they kicked it out and said I should post this over here.  I don't agree but hey I will try.

All,

I really am chaffing at the prospect of  having a 20% mandatory withholding for taxes when I begin taking 401k  disbursements next year after I retire.  I have no problem paying my  taxes but my effective tax rate in retirement will be about 11.5% at  best.  After waiting 6 months to get my last refund from the IRS I am  reluctant to give them a dime more than I need to at any point in time.   Especially when I still have state and local tax obligations to manage  as well.

I read that IRA's don't have any mandatory  withholding and I could just pay my taxes quarterly at my actual tax  rate instead of over-paying out of my 401k.  Is this true?

While  I do not want to move all of my 401K to an IRA and give up the legal  shelter that you have with a 401k, can I periodically move just what I  plan to disburse to myself from the my 401k into an IRA and pay the  quarterly taxes at the time I take my disbursement?

I know  there is a 60 day threshold that requires the money moved to the IRA to  stay there for 60 days, otherwise the mandatory withholding is  triggered.  Could I move 6 months of disbursement from my 401k into my  IRA on 1/15 and 7/15 but draw out my disbursement on 4/15 and 10/15  while paying my tax obligations quarterly from my IRA disbursements  rather than my 401k?

My understanding is that I can but I  do not know if there is an IRS limit or timing issue.  I have tried to  talk to a retirement/financial planner to get some questions answered  but every single one once to bill me multiple hours at high rates or  wants a big fee/percentage of my money just to answer my questions.

I  already have a plan that I am going to stick to and I simply need a  some answers on the best way to set things up so that they are  autopilot.  I am just looking for a mechanic to talk to about this not  an engineer to design me something I don't want.

34,personalfinance,Getting Pre-Approved for New Construction Townhome While Still Owning Current Home,"Trying to figure out what my options are here:

\--&gt; Currently own a house with a mortgage.

\--&gt; Want to downsize and buy a new construction townhome that won't be ready until Summer 2022.

Not totally positive I'll pre-qualify to for the new loan while still holding my current loan (i.e. 2 loans at once), but I obviously don't want to sell my current house now. Otherwise I'll have to rent for a year/move twice, etc.). It's also unlikely that they'll have any more townhome lots left in two or three months (if I decided to sell current house now).

Is this a common issue people face? Is there a way to hold onto my current house, get pre-approved for the new townhome, and then wait to sell my current house until next year?

(For the record, the house I'm selling will be about the same price as the townhome I'm buying...so it's not a matter of affordability...just logistically how to move the money around.)",1632331120
36,personalfinance,My rent went up 13% in NC lmao,"Called the leasing agent to confirm if this is correct (can’t imagine it’s a mistake) and the rent went up 13.3%. This is a managed apartment property. Professional managers, not a personal landlord. 

$2,0XX to $2,3XX. Yikes. This is a 2BR for 2 ppl. LCOL/MCOL area. 

for additional context: We had a 12month lease for $2,000 and it was raised $X0 of dollars (3% ish ;)). We opted into a 9 lease due to some personal BS. Naturally we paid a premium for that. However, the new rate is around $200 above both those figures (the auto renew 12mo date and the short term rate with the premium)

I guess i don’t have a personal finance question. Maybe this is more of a legal question…what thoughts come to y’all’s minds    

Is this allowed? This notice is well ahead of the lease expiration date (2 months prior). My understanding is leasing agents don’t have much control over this. Is it worth the fight to ask if this can be lowered?",1632330879

From my understanding, after 5 years have passed since your first contribution, you can withdraw your money taxfree. This means that you can withdraw everything tax free either if ur older than 59 or 5 years have passed right?

2. I also heard you can withdraw money for big purchases like a house. Is that tax-free?

In March of this year I started making after-tax contributions to my 401(k) in addition to my maxed out pre-tax contributions. On the business day after the deposit I would perform an in-plan Roth conversion. These events resulted in 9745.65 in contributions to my Roth 401(k) of which 65.88 was taxable.

45,personalfinance,Current Employer sold company effective 10/1/21 - Just told company today. How do I set myself up for the best scenario possible? More info inside.,"As stated this morning, the owner of the company I work for, let's call him Ken, (8-employees including myself) told us they have sold the company effective 10/1/2021. Ken has committed to staying with the company for 6 months to help with a smooth transition. It has been told to us that the new company ""really needs us to stay"". They need to learn from us as this is a completely new branch for the purchasing company. We were purchased to add another division to a pre-existing company. The larger company is learning how we operate in order to learn the business. 

Ken also told us we would receive a raise beginning 1/1/2022, and that if we agree to stay a year, we will receive a large bonus (more on this later). It is unsure if that bonus timeline begins 10/1/2021 or 1/1/2021. I was told we would have an individual meeting with the new company next week. I would like to go into that meeting prepared with my non-negotiables and ask for a few things to ensure I stay with the company. In addition, 401k will be offered as well as better benefits than currently offered.

**Here is some background on my position:**

I verbally told Ken I was planning on leaving at the end of the year 2-weeks ago. Ken communicated to the new company that I am thinking about leaving but this new acquisition may change my mind. All 3 parties understand I have a choice to stay if I wish.

I currently make $40,000, salary. I have been at my current job for 22 months and have not received one raise. I work in property management in a **very busy** and growing city. I do receive partial benefits, PTO (2-weeks but is very hard to take off without straining one of the 7 other employees). 

It would be very hard to find someone to replace my position for the pay/quality work that me and my colleague do. Being that Chick-fil-a is hiring for $18.50 as starting pay in our city, hiring for my position at under $20/hr is a steal. (I currently make $19.71 if my salary is divided up hourly by hours worked in a year).

My job is very cyclical. October - March is ""dead season"" and April - September my hair is on fire. We work hard as individuals and as a team. We very much look forward to our quiet days in the office because the bad days can be that bad.

My wife and I want to use this cyclical time to start a side-hustle/passive income/online business of some sort to begin that journey. We are making steps towards this as the days go by.

I am the only one fully remote on our team. In addition, I live across the country from the company I work for/will be working for.

  
**What I would like to see changed moving forward:**

A raise effective immediately on my next paycheck **as well as** the one mentioned for 1/1/2022. The minimum I want to be paid is $50,000/year by 1/1/2021. As mentioned, I have not received a raise since working for this company.

I would also like my 1-year bonus to be no less than $10,000. The owner of our company told us if we stayed an entire year during the transition, the new company will offer us a bonus. In addition, our current boss will **match** that bonus. My goal would be for each party to give $5000. 

A change in our system to make it more streamlined. When I began at this office **everything was still on paper.** I was able to ""create"" systems through COVID and make a successful position working remote. However, unless we do a whole overhaul on how we process things, we are still really inefficient. We were told we would be changing the software we use at the beginning of the year so I think that is a positive sign.

Lastly, PTO. I would like to take PTO (Or have others take PTO) where we do not cause a total strain on another team member. Currently, we have to have someone cover 100% while out of the office. When we come back we have to jump in and sort through everything and it's super time-consuming and a strain for everyone involved. I shouldn't regret taking time away from work.

I would be willing to stay another year if the price is right. I would like the change-up in scenery as I've gotten bored the last 6-ish months. I do like that I have mastered my job and mostly everything is 2nd nature to me at this point - it's just doing it. 

If it does not go well, I will continue my plan of ending my employment at end of year this year and work on a new position in the meantime.

How do I communicate this to them as well as give myself the best opportunity for my requests? I do believe it will be a Zoom call since I am cross country. 

Thank you for reading all of this, if you have! I really don't want to mess up this potential opportunity.",1632330030
46,personalfinance,What to do with extra income,"I'm currently debating on leaving an established position with an established company to essentially create a new division (doing the same thing I do currently) with an established company, but not in my business sector.  For all intensive purposes, think of this as I sell really great Tuna sandwiches at Subway, but I'm considering leaving and adding my great tuna sandwich to Arbys. 

Anyway, the salary increase is from 150k to 500k, with the same bonus earning potential (another 50-150k).  We live within the means of my salary currently, and spend any bonus or my wife's earnings on extra wants.  We could live comfortably and not have to go without anything within reason on my salary alone.

For what it's worth, I think my ""tuna sandwich"" will sell well at Arby's just fine, so im not worried about performance, but I am worried about leaving an already very good environment for something potentially better, or potentially worse.

I'm having trouble working this through, and a bit overwhelmed with fear of regret, and I think its because I can't visualize how life will be different with that large of a salary increase.  So for anyone that could offer advise on how to map out that kind of salary increase, and more importantly what you can do with it (both for fun and in planning for the future), I would greatly appreciate it.

54,personalfinance,What to do after Debt Collector 'verifies' debt?,"About two months ago I got a letter from a collection agency saying I owed rent to the last apartment I lived at. (Which, not the most important part, but there were two people on the lease and I'm the only one getting the collection on this, is that normal?) We paid our rent every month on time, and so I did not think this was a valid debt, an itemization said it was for rent and utilities and not anything like missing keys or move-out cleaning costs or anything that might have been bullshit, but something I couldn't have disputed basically. But rent, we paid. So, I sent a dispute letter asking for more info. (Basically filled this template out and sent it off: [https://www.safetyweb.org/healthwatchwi/publications/Letter%20to%20a%20Collector%20Requesting%20More%20Information.doc.pdf](https://www.safetyweb.org/healthwatchwi/publications/Letter%20to%20a%20Collector%20Requesting%20More%20Information.doc.pdf))

&amp;#x200B;

Well, a week ago, the more info came. And it was the same amount of info. It has my name, an breakdown of the rent owed and utilities owed and a move out date and apartment number. This came along with a letter saying (paraphrased) ""We investigated your dispute and haven't found sufficient evidence to validate your claim(s). It is very important that you provide us with all relevant documents to support your position."" Which seemed like bs since it didn't have all of the stuff I was requesting, but after poking around it seems all they have to send is what I got. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I finally get in contact with the apartments (did try to contact them when the first thing came in, but they were bad at being in the office when I lived there and it seems that issue didn't get better, and once I sent the dispute letter for more info, I didn't try any more). After some people trying to be genuinely helpful, the apartment in the end says they can't do anything once its with the collection agency, and if there was a mistake they would have caught it before it was sent to a collection agency. However I did learn from them that this rent is definitely for December, a month we did not live there. The apartment person suggested I prove that I didn't live there that month with my electricity cut-off date and a lease for a new place. Both of which don't seem like the most solid evidence. On top of which, I set the cut-off date to be one day into December so I didn't get charged any fees for it lapsing while we were still there. And the fact that I do not have a lease as my roommate at the apartment was the one who bought a house, so my name isn't anywhere on that. (Though my forwarding address on the final bill for electricity is the We have thought of more sort of weak evidence that we can pile on in the same realm (uhaul receipts to show moving in November, bank statements to show paying rent for all prior months). But all of this seems like they could just say, no you lived there and you owe this, and they have all the power? I honestly don't see how it can say a move out date of 11/30/2020 and be December rent in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

All that is to say, every debt collection advice I see online details the first step, but I'm not sure what to do now. Do I send them all of the evidence I can muster and say, no really I don't think I owe this? Does any of this stand a chance of them saying, yeah you don't owe this? Part of me wants to pay it just to get rid of the stress it causes. Another part of me is violently against paying something I know I don't owe. Just, I guess, any tips or advice for what to do next?

&amp;#x200B;

57,personalfinance,Newborn: 529 vs Standard savings,"Hey all,

Just curious on peoples opinions on having a standard savings account vs. a 529.  I understand the benefit of the 529 IF your child is going to college.  Personally, I have no idea if my 1 month old will or not.  Many people push this method of saving but I feel that the future is quite unpredictable with college and its associated costs.  The other fear is that if tax rates continue to rise the funds could be taxed to the same or higher degree to the amount of interest they earned over the years which completely defeats the purpose of the 529.

I personally enjoy the idea of building a savings account and turning it over to him when he graduates high school.  I think it will be an oppurtunity to teach the responsibility and habit of saving.  It could also be a great and extremely tough way for him to learn about spending depending how he treats the funds at that age.  

I have considered doing both but I hate the idea of distributing the funds to build two mediocre accounts vs one substantial one.

58,personalfinance,"Mortgage Company already offering a lower rate, refi, 5 months into the loan","We purchased our first home back in April and took out a mortgage for roughly $140,000 through NewRez. I've gotten at least two notices letting me know that my mortgage has been sold to a different company (currently Freddi, iirc) but that I should keep paying NewRez.

While going through the mail I came across an offer from NewRez with the following;

||Current Loan|New Loan|
:--|:--|:--|
|Balance:|$139,954|$139,954|
|Rate|3.25%|2.875% / 3.064% APR|

|Remaining Term|29 years 9 months|30 years|

I will mention that getting the mortgage (and taking out a loan on a used truck to replace my 18yo one) moved my score from 790 to 815, so perhaps that's what prompted the letter.

So my question is, what IS the catch? Just that the clock resets? Seems to me that the lender will miss out on a lot of interest, but perhaps taking their offer is a way for them to take back my loan from Freddie and get the interest for themselves instead?",1632327451

62,personalfinance,"Should I cash out my 401k, take out a loan, or just pay interest on late fees?","Hey PF gang. Long time lurker, occasional participant here. Have been spending the last couple of years getting myself out of various holes that I dug myself into in my 20s, and now I'm in a better spot than before. However, part of putting my life back together involved launching a custody modification case which seemed like it could be settled out of court but is now on the verge of going into a full-on trial. I'm already $8,000 into this, but I'm looking at potentially spending another $10-20k in the next 4-5 months. At the outset of this, I was expecting to spend $6,000 at the upper end of the scale -- so I'm in a little bit of a crunch.

Net monthly income is a shade over $3,800 after child support, living expenses total about $2k, so I've got $1,800 worth of wiggle room on a monthly basis, but over the last few months pretty much all of this has gone to attorney fees. I only have $1,000 in savings currently (I recently took a new job for a significant pay increase and had nearly drained my savings at the time I made the switch). I could realistically cut living expenses a down a little bit further, but not to a point where I'll miraculously find enough wiggle room to afford all of this without financing.

So, hypothetically, let's say that I'll be racking up on average a $5,000 monthly bill November-February. I'm able to pay off $1,800 each month, and every penny that's sitting in my open balance for longer than 30 days accrues a 1.5% interest charge every 30 days. By my math, I'd end up paying $1,167.68 in interest fees and would have the full amount paid off within 9 months of the conclusion of the case.

Another option I have -- since I recently changed jobs, I have about $9,300 in a 401k account from my previous employer. After taxes/penalties, I could get $6,500 out of this, which certainly isn't anywhere near what I need, but would at least provide a slight cushion and delay the onset of the initial interest charges to the extent that I would save nearly $1,000 in interest fees and would have the balance paid in full within 4 months (basically I'd be able to pay the first two $5,000 bills without issue or having to accrue interest on either one). Of course, downside to this being my retirement savings are now gone (I'm 31, for what it's worth).

The final option I'm considering is taking out a personal loan. My credit isn't great (I am finally back in the low 600s after fighting back from the mid-400s), so this is far and away the most expensive option. However, it \*would\* help me to rebuild my credit, and I could also use funds from this loan to pay off an outstanding collections debt of nearly $5k which would be a major boon to my credit. I'm not as likely to pursue this option, but another opportunity to build credit is always attractive.

64,personalfinance,How do I optimize my tax burden when selling IRA and non IRA mutual funds?,"BLUF: I want to sell some of my assets, which are mainly mutual funds, but I don't think I want to use a average cost basis. What do I need to consider moving forward?

1) Basically I have mutual funds like most everybody else that I buy into a little bit here and there throughout the year. I have some in an IRA Roth and some in just a plain brokerage account (not IRA). My understanding is when I sell some funds from the brokerage account, tax is computed on the capital gains based on an average cost basis. That will include how much of the asset I'm selling and when those shares were purchased. I believe there's a drop off in taxes on capital gains if held for longer than a year, long-term capital gains. So what I would like to do is to sell some of the assets I bought over a year ago to reduce the capital gains tax I will pay. 

Example: I bought 10 shares of VTSAX January 2020. Then I bought another 10 shares in January of 2021. I believe vanguard allows you to change the cost basis from an average method to another method. Does that help, or make a difference, if you sell 10 shares out of the 20 share pot, or separate the pot into the two purchase events, and sell only the shares older than one year?

2) For the Roth IRA, My understanding is that I could separate the money I contributed and the money earned from capital gains. I can do the separation in the account and sell only my contribution portion, which should not be taxed because they are not capital gains. Thus, The account would have in cash, all the money I can contributed, and all the money in capital gains would be held as stock or mutual funds inside the Roth IRA. Is there anything wrong with this thinking? The motivation is that in times of market instability, I can sell my Roth contributions to hold in cash in the Roth account to hedge my losses on the capital gains in the account if the market goes down. Note: I will not be taking any disbursement from the Roth account. Only moving the money from a mutual fund to a settlement account (money market) inside the Roth account.",1632326884

Okay, so, a couple months back I applied for CareCredit because my dog required surgery and I was unable to afford it up front. With a stroke of luck, I was able to pay off the entire balance in one-go just two days ago. The reason I did this was because I figured, since they advertise as a regular credit card, that what I paid towards my balance would go back on my available credit. My dog has another vet appointment tomorrow so I figured I could just use CareCredit again after paying it off in full.

My balance is now showing $0 (so I know they processed the payment), but my available credit is still the amount I had left on there before making the payment.

Am I just misunderstanding? If so, this feels more like a one-time-loan than an actual credit card. Does anyone have a definitive answer for me? Will my available credit update? Or is that not how it works?

72,personalfinance,Significant Income Increase And Overwhelmed By Options,"Hello all,

I am 26 years old and work in marketing in Orlando. I had been saving some money back in 2018 and had around $12,000 but unfortunately was laid off twice over the year and burnt through basically all of my savings. I was making around $45,000-$50,000 back then. In Jan of 2019 I landed a job paying $50,000. Summer of 2020 I got a $5,000 increase to put me around $58,000.

Last month I negotiated a promotion because I had been doing managerial level work, but they only brought me up to $65,000. The job market is super hot and I've had recruiters reaching out to me left and right and just accepted an offer for a job that pays $60/hour, 40 hours a week, on a W2 paid weekly. It's a 6 month contract and they are looking to convert and extend. Of course none of that is guaranteed, but a lot of the job offers and interviews I have been getting have been around $85-100k. Assuming I take off 3 weeks a year like a standard PTO, that puts me around $118,000 for the year.

After taxes, and before vacation days that puts me now at net.

Monthly: Around $7,800

Weekly: Around $1,800

I currently have no retirement savings and no big emergency fund. I know a 4-6 month emergency fund is my first step.

I have a car loan at $425/month that has $13,320 left on it at 3.290% interest going until about March of 2024. It's a 2017 Maxima with 53,000 miles on it that I received a quote on from Carmax and is worth $21,500 currently to sell to them at a $8,000 difference between what I can get an owe. After interest and taxes and fees and upgrades the car came out to $27,900 for the car loan at 7,000 miles on it back in 2018. A bit below market value.

I currently rent an apartment and split the rent with a roommate. I'm paying $850 in rent and after all utilities it comes to around $1,000 a month. My lease ends in December, and I have the option to renew. Hopefully rent doesn't skyrocket as it has been doing all over Orlando.

I spend way too much eating out and can cut that down a lot.

My biggest questions are on retirement, saving for a house, and what to do with my car.

I will now be making an ***additional*** $3,100 or so, after taxes, every single month. Assuming just the 6 month contract, that's close to $20k I will be saving if I didn't save a penny of the money I was making before the job switch. I can probably be near $40-50k after a year depending on how tight I budget.

I'm worried about house prices continuing to rise and interest rates starting to come up as well. I'm renting, which I know isn't always just throwing money away, but I'd like to start getting equity in something.

I'm also worried about not having any retirement savings currently. I'm looking into a Roth IRA. Given I am a W2 contractor, there is no 401k match currently.

Also wondering if I should do something about my car, given it seems to be in a prime spot right now of value, compared to what is left owed on it. I drive quite a bit and worry if I wait a year or two years to sell it will drop drastically in value once it approaches 80-100k miles. I know then buying a replacement car may be tough with the chip shortage, but having that extra $8,000 in the bank sounds nice to use for a down payment or retirement catch up.

Living in a safe and nice place and driving a decent car are important to me. I eat out a bit, and can cut back on that. I don't spend a ton on clothes or alcohol or random things. I take a couple road trips a year.

What is my best course of option moving forward over the next year or so? I am at around $118k, and know that job isn't guaranteed forever, but feel confident in being able to at minimum land at a job that pays $85-90k if things didn't pan out there.",1632326166
73,personalfinance,Getting a mortgage while self employed.,"I currently work a corporate 9-5 and I'm going to be leaving in the spring to start my own business.  I do not currently own a home but would like to buy one as soon as I can.  My original plan was to buy a house right before I left my job because I know it can be difficult to get a mortgage while self employed as banks want to see 2 years of income.  But if I wait to buy a house later while I'm self employed, I will have more capital for my business.

If I decide to wait to buy a house, I know banks are going to scrutinize my income more because I'll be self employed.  My question is, how much more lenient will banks be if I put down a larger down payment?  I should be able to put down as much as 20% or maybe a bit more, how much will this help me in trying to get a mortgage?

I do not expect to have any income my first year as my expenses will equal my profit, roughly (maybe I'll get lucky and that won't be the case).  But my 2nd year I should have a respectable income and it will only grow from there.  My credit score is very high (mid 700s).

81,personalfinance,Personal loan or balance transfer card?,"Hello, 

I am wondering which is the best option for paying off some debt that I have. 

Discover: just under $2,000  
Amazon: about $1,000

These debts came up over the past year or so where I had multiple large unexpected payments and life changes. I can elaborate if needed, however I'm keeping the post as vague as I can while trying to include details needed. For context, these large expenses also completely drained my savings, which I am slowly building back up and have about $1,000 so I am looking into these options to pay back my debt and still be able to continue building my savings, otherwise I would just pay back as normal. 

  
Currently I am weighing a personal loan or a balance transfer credit card (both have great approval odds on CreditKarma as my score is \~735 and climbing, dropped about 2 years ago for some dumb things that are remedied now). 

I'm not sure if balance transfer would be the best as I have two sets of debts, but I know that would help my score in the long run having another card (though right now it would cut my average age of credit down which might make it drop). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am more heavily considering a personal loan for the below reasons:  


* multiple options that have no early payback fees
* I'm considering renewing my car lease next month as chips are in high demand and the dealership would buy back my current car in full right now (my car lease ends in about a year normally). I would likely take out a bit extra for the loan to help with down payment. 
* If I don't use the extra amount taken out towards a new car lease, then I would feed it back into paying off the loan

TL;DR: A couple withdrew $200k from IRA which enabled them to pay cash for a house that cost over $500k. Due to their normal working income not being taxable they assumed withdrawals from IRA would not be taxable either, so they were wondering whether or not to get a HELOC to pay the 10% penalty for early withdrawal. Turns out the penalty became the least of their worries.

What I learned today: 1) Don’t buy a house you can’t afford, 2) spending a dollar to keep from saving a dime is not a good financial strategy, and 3) know the tax implications before making large withdrawals from taxable retirement accounts, i.e. seek professional help if you are least bit unsure of the tax laws.

7,personalfinance,"Starting mortgage pre approval, loan officer not concerned about debt collection on record?","I have an outstanding debt collection from a previous shady landlord (2.8k), and the money to address it in full set aside, on my credit record. I also have commitment from the collection agency to close the debt at only 2k but without the ability to “pay for delete” the record entirely; they say it’s not their policy to do this for “valid debt”. Miraculously, my credit score has withstood this ding as it was higher before this happened and I have taken steps to decrease credit usage, etc. I am beginning the mortgage pre approval process with my loan officer soon and asked about rapid rescore and if I closed the collection, what impact that would have on my credit score. While he said he will run the rapid rescore simulations to advise on best next steps, closing out the collection will likely have little to no effect on my score, wouldn’t prevent me from being approved for a mortgage and will eventually cycle off my credit anyway. My question: does this sound right to you? I personally want my credit cleared of this collection but am worried A) closing it would be throwing money away and / or B) not closing it may have detrimental effect I can’t anticipate yet. Help!

I’ve learned that I can purchase my one year of service that I worked for the state of NY, and apply it towards my service time for NC. I don’t know the price yet, but the person assisting me said typically it’s several thousand dollars.

Other variables:

- Apparently, the price to purchase that year of service will only go up from here as I get closer to retirement age.

- I’m getting married this year and don’t have the cash to do this, but the person from My pension system said that I can take from my 401k and pay for it that way, and said it was like a loan to myself.

- I haven’t committed to staying with the state of North Carolina for the rest of my career, so who knows how many years of service I may end up with. If I stick it out here, then retiring a year early sounds enticing. Also, even if I only do ten years or so, the way our pension payment calculated works is that your payments go up with every month of service.

Have Best Buy debt of $3000. Also paying 0% interest. So by Jan 2022-Feb 2022 this should be paid off as well. 

I can possibly pay this off sooner if get a good bonus come the end of the year, but not counting on it.

I have a 2010 charger sxt got it for 5500 + bs warranty for $1500. I’ll explain my financial situation on the loan and insurance deductibles. I put $1300 down I needed a car ASAP for transportation needs. Insurance deductibles are on the high side because I’ve been in 3 accidents 2 at fault and one not at fault even though one was just minor scratches on vehicle other driver wanted to file a claim anyway even though I offered him cash on the spot. 2k collision and $750 comp. I’ve had this car since July and I’ve already had to replace the starter because car had stalling issues. Little to no money saved due to paying off most of student loans recently but not expecting something like this to happen, decent credit score 660 one credit card and 3 open loans all payments on time. Anyway last week I was driving and I hit a pothole on a road leading to the highway and when I got on the highway after most my 15 min ride home I heard rattling and before I could stop in time my splash shield ripped off,  I pulled over and was able to get it as it fell on the right side of the shoulder onto the grass. Looked up if it was safe to drive without it for a few days until the one I was going to order came in and people said yea as long as it’s not raining or extremely wet conditions in when I’m driving I should be good as it shields the engine and oil pan from dirt gunk debris etc... checked for leaks and didn’t see anything dripping, continued the rest of the way home.  A few days later also wasn’t raining at all during this period, driving on the highway I hear weird noises during acceleration, once again almost home oil light during braking didn’t come on making tight turns on the drive only braking after I was on the highway, I  get to the off ramp hear a rumbling groaning sound and lost all power and pulled to the side of the ramp. Was able to start the car again but it died again after.  I checked for leaks all throughout this period at home while out and didn’t see anything also when this happened there was still oil left in the car even tho it was low no where near bone dry. It’s at dodge right now it’s been a week and they still haven’t taken it apart to see the reason because here lies my problem if I hit something in the road again after the shield fell off causing the oil pan to crack caused this I will have to file a claim through insurance I don’t know if I will be able to file under comprehensive (will have to borrow money from my mom) under collision (will have to take out 2k loan) if it’s a mechanical failure that caused this my extended warranty deductible is $250 which I’ll be able to pay but now know after reading reviews my claim will most likely be denied because it’s a shady company (superior protection plan vehicle service contract). Now the car has ~180k miles and the dodge dealership said that they don’t know if my insurance will label it a total loss  because of the mileage and the cost of if I need a new engine/other related repairs due to this breakdown, they still haven’t actually taken the car apart or performed the diagnosis to see what caused this. It’s been a week and the dealership is just telling me that they’re a couple weeks behind this and that they’ll try to get to it as soon as possible but they’re backed up close to the end of this month.  I live w my mom and don’t have to pay rent but realistically can go up to 3 weeks from now before I’m worrying about financial security missed payments and job security so I’m trying to get this figured out ASAP. Me and my girlfriend both signed off on the loan and she had no credit but now has a 610 score but id feel really shitty if my missed payments start to effect her. I’d honestly prefer to go through insurance now after reading the reviews about my extended warranty company because of the time and haggling involved based on the reviews but would still be open to this option if it’s possible under warranty $250 deductible I’d be stupid. Now if I have to go through insurance would they most likely make it be covered under collision if there’s a crack in the oil pan or somewhere that caused a leak or would I somehow be able to get it covered under comp? What would I be dealing with if they labeled it a total loss? Do I pay my deductible and they give me a check of the remaining value? Do I have to pay a deductible and they just give me a check for the what the remaining value of the car was? I’m just not trying to go into this process blind if I have to go through insurance and I’d also like to keep the car as I still have a loan out on it but I know there’s a option of it being a total loss if I need a new engine. Me and my girlfriend both work but we’re both out of work right now her for coincidentally medical reasons (unpaid leave) and me well I don’t have transportation anymore. Her job is cool with her missing a little extra time and I let my job know as well by 3 weeks id really like to get back to work. I get the rebate of the warranty if I don’t use it I think after cancelling it but I for sure get the $1500 taken off the loan so I owe about $5k rn and realistically me and my girlfriend both working can pay that off in 2 months if I have to take out a 2k loan in 3 months. I’m really not trying to go into this process blind would really like some advice and if anyone could answer my questions about the insurance total loss value. Also one last thing I’m not trying to wait 2 weeks just for diagnosis it’s already been a week so by Saturday if the dealership doesn’t get to my car and lmk what caused this I’m towing (free towing up to a certain amount of miles with my warranty company) it to another shop so I can get a diagnosis ASAP and get this process started because I know it will be a lot of variables to account for without the diagnosis if it’s a mechanical failure or a crack from hitting something in the road that faused this.(free towing up to a certain amount of miles) with my warranty company.

49,personalfinance,I am 18 and currently in college full-time. What steps can I take to ensure long-term financial security?,"For some context, I’ve already taken some steps to make sure I’m in a good financial spot.

I did enough in high school to not have to pay for college and am currently attending an in-state university, to ensure that I get the most benefits.

I own a car since I asked a family member who had one in their driveway if they’d sell it to me, I got it for cheap for so as long as I repaired it, I did so manually to cut costs and it works now. 

I live at home, still hold my weight and was working until college started.

Opened a student checking account with no monthly fees until I’m 24, has low interest accrued however.

I have a fair amount of money and do want to move out within the next year (don’t have a good relationship with my family), probably with roommates or something of the sort to be closer to campus. 

But I understand that there has to be things budgeted aside such as food, household items, and bills. Are these valuations very steep? I understand that bills are the biggest one on this list.

For those of you who are/were in my situation, how did your surpass it?

53,personalfinance,Raise or PTO opinions,"Inspired to post after lurking for some time, throw away of course. Minor details to stay anonymous 

Started the job hunt because I felt unfulfilled at my current position, spend majority of my time staring at the wall. Not lazy, just the way night shift goes. Got offered a job but hesitant to take it because of the PTO, standard 10 days a year no roll over. 

Not worried about retirement or medical, both positions are equal in that aspect. This would be a short term move (1 year- 2) as my fiancé and I wish to move out of state.

Im stuck because my current position offers:
- $71k (underpaid based on talking to colleagues and research) 
- 2 days of pto/sick accrued monthly with roll over, 3 years in, have used a lot though. 
-basically clock in clock out position but the schedule is terrible usually works out 7 days on and 2 off then 8 days on 4 off but sometimes 3. 
-Management is a joke and chances of a raise are slim to none
-No room for advancement but its an easy position and steady employment 

New position:
-$95.5k so almost a 35% increase  
-But only 10 days pto no roll over 
-monday through friday day work but the starting hours could very depending on what’s needed
-My days would be spent actually working, which I do enjoy. Also would help with my overall experience because I would be learning new things with this company.

I know its vague but basically I’m stuck wondering if I stay were im at, use some leave I have saved up/accrue and coast by another year kinda taking it easy. Working a terrible schedule instead of having to start something new for just a year or jump ship for more money and an opportunity to learn some things over the next year but have to deal with varying start times and less PTO?",1632293144

In 2019 I was in a pretty bad situation and needed a car fast. So young and dumb me went and signed on a loan that’s ended up killing me financially ever since. Especially since I had only a few months of credit history. (APR is 24.44%) My car value is not worth what I owe on it anymore. If I traded it in the negative equity would either have to be paid off then and there or be rolled into a new loan which sounds pretty dumb to do. I could sell it privately but owe 7-8k on the loan. Or trade and let someone take over the payments but no one would be willing to do that for the price I’m paying. I don’t really know of any other options and I’ve google searched all of them.

69,personalfinance,22 years old and need help exploring my future financial/housing options,"Hi, I am 22 years old and recently graduated college in May. This is going to be pretty long... Currently I live in apartment where I pay around $650 (w utils) per month - which is extremely cheap for my location (my roommate pays 2/3rd of the rent). Our lease is going to expire in February and my roommate is going to live with his girlfriend so I need to look for a new place to live. I have three options:

1. Purchase a home and *potentially* have 3 roommates
2. *Potentially* rent a home with the same roommates
3. Rent a 1br apartment

I work in tech (which could mean frequent salary increases) and gross \~$59k. I am prequalified up to $400k for a mortgage. I have no debt, no car payments, and no other expenses besides food &amp; gas ( fortunately my parents pay for my phone and insurance still). If I do purchase a home I would only put 3% down. I have enough for 10%, but then I would have no savings and 5% does not make much of a difference on the monthly payments so 3% makes the most sense to me.

Issues with Option 1: All the homes in my price range are only 3 bedrooms and are all at the high-end of my range; which could potentially leave me house poor with no roommates. I do not know if it is a good idea to take on housing payments that are around 55% of my monthly net income. The roommates that I could have are 3 of my close friends that were already planning on getting a place together within the next 3-5 months. 2 of them are okay with sharing a room in bedroom home - however I already know that could not be a long term option and they will probably move out before even a year of living there. Leaving me making payments on my own (there is a decent chance that I have other friends that would be willing to move in around a year from now). I would charge $400 a room plus utilities and not have them sign a lease, which I know is a bad decision financially but they are my friends and I do not want to live with random people. There are just a lot of uncertainties with a decision this large. All standard expenses considered: with roommates I could save \~40% of my income and without roommates probably \~20%.

Option 2 does not have too many downsides I just really would like to take advantage of the low interest rates right now. The renters market is not too optimistic. Also, I make considerably more than my friends and it is definitely a risk going into a lease with people that work part-time because I could get stuck with payments (there is a \~1% chance this would ever happen though).

Issues with Option 3: A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is around $1300-$1700, and are continually rising. I would hate to pay even $1500/mo for an apartment when I could pay $2000/mo towards an investment (home).

Sorry if it sounds like I am ranting, it is just a big decision to make so I have a lot going through my head.",1632288375

73,personalfinance,Should I move out or save,"Hey guys so I need a little bit of advice on what to do.
I’m 22 and I live in Sydney Australia.
I am currently in the process of saving up for an apartment and I am hoping to have saved around 40k for a down payment by the end of 2022. I currently have about 10k in savings, and I make about 50k a year at the moment. I live with my uncle at the moment as I am paying $150 a week in rent. However as much as I love my uncle and appreciate him letting me stay with him, I love my privacy and I’ve always wanted to move out. 

My question is, should I save up $25k-$30k and move out into a decently sized apartment   paying $400-$450 a week, atm i’m making $1k a week. I do understand that this is 40% of my income however my logic behind it is:

1. It is only a temporary stay, as I will still be saving for my own place still
2. It will give me a chance to experience renting properly without the commitment of buying
3. I will need to buy furniture regardless so this will get that out of the way
4. I am 22 and I want to experience living by myself 

I do understand that i’ll save money quicker living with my uncle however im not exactly in a rush to buy, I HOPE to have the down payment by the end of next year however it doesn’t HAVE to happen. 

Is this a stupid logic to go buy and what would you guys suggest, staying an extra couple months, saving or moving! Thanks guys",1632287493
74,personalfinance,How do I go about buying my in laws home and letting them live there for the rest of their lives?,"     They owe 13k on a mobile home of unknown value. They have been offered 60 for just the land (about 9 acres in central Arkansas) and I believe it's value is closer to 80k.
     My father in law is 81 and wants to quit his part time job. They could pay everything off in 2 years but he wants to stop working now. They would like to sell it to me for 34k with the guarantee they can live in the house for the rest of their lives granting me use of the majority of the property until then. 
      I love the area and would love to build a home there in the next 6 years. The 34k would enable them to pay off their two largest bills, allowing my father in law to stop working. They could then afford to live off of just my mother in laws income.
     The issue is I would need to finance the 34k and they want the land the house is on split into a different parcel so that if my financial circumstance change the house is protected. I'm fine with this but I'm sure a lender wouldn't be as they would essentially be lending me money for a large but empty parcel. The home is currently on an FHA loan so I could assume it and pay it off and then split the parcel, but then I would need to finance the other 21k somehow to make that available to them to pay off their vehicle. I'm sure there is a simple solution here I am missing. The only other caveat is they would either want all of our names on the deed for the parcel with the home or some other assurance they are guaranteed to live there regardless of the unforseen. I'm fine with that. I just know it can complicate things further. I do have about 10k in cash I can use if necessary.

How do I proceed?","Throwaway because throwaway. I'm a collegiate athletic coach, and this summer a school near to the city I recently moved to abruptly had a full change of coaching staff for my sport. They had a quick hire for the head coach (who is a personal friend, and someone I have worked with before), and my interview process was relatively streamlined for his assistant position; I had to formally input an application, but I am very well-qualified and after a brief phone interview from someone in athletics, I was more or less offered the job. By ""brief phone interview"", I mean I had a ten minute chat with an assistant athletic director to make sure I wasn't crazy, and that I could confirm some details of my resume. I didn't speak to anyone with HR, and since it was so brief I assumed there would be other opportunities to discuss specifics of the position, including compensation. A few days later I was asked for information in relation to a background check, which I happily gave.

Fast forward to today (about three weeks after that call). The fall season is under way and due to a complication with my background check HR only got approval to hire me today. They reach out, asking for me to come in and take care of new-hire paperwork, and send me a copy via email. it includes a pay rate... but nothing else other than ordinary onboarding materials (direct deposit, tax forms, etc.). In other words, I haven't had a conversation with anyone about benefits or compensation, and I don't feel great about that.

I'm not sure how to open up the conversation about salary. Part of me feels like I should have been explicit about what I was looking for earlier, and I'm worried that bringing it up now would seem like I'm trying to squeeze them; because the season's started, there's some pressure to get someone working ASAP, and since we're this far along I know I'm the person they want. At the same time, I honestly didn't know when I should bring it up, since the only call I had was with an AD for a quick chat back in August.

How do I approach this? My number is about 12% higher than what they're offering. I know this is consistent with what other coaches are making in the city with my skillset, and is largely a COL adjustment for the metro area I'm living in.

My dad had to take some time off work earlier this year due to some minor health issues he needed to get taken care of. He couldn't return to work until he had clearance from his doctor. While he was out of work he was getting paid medical leave pay (disability I'm assuming) from his job for an undisclosed amount of weeks. Somehow after this leave was exhausted he was told to apply for unemployment even though technically he was still employed through his job? (That part is confusing). 

Well my dad thought his job was initially paying out disability, but when he checked into his accounts he realized his 401k was at $0. I asked him how much was in his 401k he said only 3k with this specific company. They paid out his 401 and used his vacation hours but told him it was under the guise of disability pay. 

The doctors gave him clearance months ago and his job is continuously asking for more paperwork to prove he can come back. He's a truck driver. He never told them he wanted to quit or leave the job. His job told EDD that he refused to come back to work. All of this sounds weird and shady, but he's wondering if this was illegal that they paid out his 401k without his knowledge.

Used to, since I live with mom but she only asks every now and then since pandemic.) and my bills are my car insurance, gas, and my car payments. I also buy groceries or video games on sale, my own toiletries etc. 

So, my main question is - my current car is an Audi Q5. I bought it before I started going back to school and quit working full-time at a pretty well-paying job. It’s 2011, and 82k miles. Second owner, extremely good condition and maintained at the same dealership. Very low mileage for what it is. 
Should I sell it and get a new car?

It only takes premium gas and each time I fill up my tank is $60/$65. Which is going to be weekly, since my classes are an hour away from my home and I head there 4x a week. 
Nothings wrong with it aside from that and the costly maintenance, and I’m assuming the higher it goes in mileage the more likely problems will show up and the value will be rapidly decreasing. 

I’m pre-approved for a car loan, and to be honest I’ve been looking at getting a Subaru. Pre-owned are worth nearly as much as brand new, and I’d rather pay a little more for the warranties/the extra 20k miles. 

Considering that my bills will stay mostly the same, and that I will be racking up about 30k a year in mileage - should I sell my current car and get the Subaru that will lower my car payments/insurance/gas and whatever else, but be in debt for a few more years?

I have a comfortable, stable job in an expensive area in California. My monthly net income is ~$5200. I would estimate my monthly expenditures to be comfortably ~$3800 (with room to go down, I would just call this average though).

My credit score is not great due to a combination of a parent taking credit cards out under my name as a minor/in college and a couple missed student loan payments when I couldn’t secure a job straight out of college…It’s a miracle I was able to convince the landlord to rent me my current apartment. I have about a 600 flat. Any advice on improving is appreciated! I currently have ~$30k in student loans I am working on, a $300 credit card that I just recently worked up from “secured” status (started with a 520 score and I guess they trust me more now?), and a $2000 (out of $4000 max) line for a computer that I was told to pay off “not too quickly, but quick enough”(?).

I am a baby when it comes to financial responsibility…I’ve followed advice of getting a secured card and other credit lines, paying on time for all, trying not to accumulate more debt, etc. My savings aren’t impressive, but I have about $10k…

My car is dying it seems. It still runs, but has significant issues, so idk for how much longer. It’s a ‘98 so investing thousands into it may have diminishing returns. I’d like to buy a new/gently used car (as I’ve never had a “newish” vehicle before) but I’ve heard that now is not a good time to buy cars. I also would like to eventually save up and move somewhere (probably out of California) where I can put a down payment on a home…everything in due time though, I know.

Anyways, to condense: immediate goal is to improve credit. I’ll need a newer ride sooner or later, but idk if it’s better to wait for credit to improve (worst case I can fall back on bike/public transportation), or if I can refinance later? Want to establish better savings too. I max out my employer match on 401k, so retirement savings is not my goal atm, just want to have a safety net/be able to buy a house. General advice appreciated too!

97,personalfinance,Roth IRA: VTSAX or VTWAX? Please help,"Hello Everyone,

I couldn't get my mind off of which Index Fund I should invest in my Roth IRA. So I'm 20 years old, and I have no idea what my future income will be like, but it'll be under 140k. My thoughts are to choose one Index Fund/ETF because I don't want to diversify too much in a limited contribution portfolio and because I want to gain the most amount of compound interest. I also don't know what my future holds and if I can make more investment portfolios(Traditional Roth, Roth 401k, Traditional 401K, long-term port, HSA, etc.), max out my Roth IRA each year. I think a lot of you will be against this, which is why I'm wondering if I should choose VTSAX or VTWAX? I know a perfect portfolio should be 60-80% in the U.S and 20-40% in the international market, but I want the most growth in my Roth IRA and retiring with over a million dollars tax-free. I've also seen controversy with people saying owning VTSAX is getting your hands wet already internationally since there are companies doing business internationally. Even JL Collins said to buy VTSAX when VT was around. Looking at VTWAX ETF equivalent VT, it's evident that VTSAX performed better. But I know in 40 years, this may not be the case, and no one really knows what market will dominate. I'm just super conflicted and eager to make the most money possible, and I don't have anyone else to talk to about investing. If someone can please give me their thoughts about all this to help me make a better financial move for my future, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you!",1632280113

Said it was to protect my at risk mom, but it was cus I was about to snap(I was getting angry). I was nine months into a bank teller job and my first taste of middle class after growing up in poverty. Credit was 680 and could have been higher if not for a high usage on my credit cards. Had only 2.5k limit and maxed it buying guns. Month before the pandemic I got two used 2018 cars totaling about 34k. One for fun and one for work/sibling use. Anyways once I quit my job I started doordashing and was making more than my bank job while ridding myself of the stress of a pandemic customer facing job. After a month I got sick with COVID, my mom passed, my whole family was infected. I gained 50 lbs and couldn't work full-time with the stunted lung capacity. I stopped working, I stopped paying for all my loans, credit cards, and cars. I voluntarily repoed my cars. I gave up. After everything was set and done I was about 10k in debt, two repos on my credit, and my credit is now in the low 400's. My current situation is this. I had nothing so a family member got me a car with their credit so I could doordash again, and gave me a credit card with a 4k limit(which I maxed out). I am working doordash and giving a sibling rides to work making about $1100 a month. I am also going to the gym three times a week trying to get under 400lbs again like I was before COVID which means I have to take days off from doordash for recovery. My expenses are $1300(car, fuel, gym,paying minimums on a few loans/credit cards). I have another family member paying the spread. They will only pay the spread if I keep going to the gym and eating healthy. I'm feeling stuck, I don't know how to get more income in without screwing over my sibling I take to work as they don't have a driver's license. I also feel too obese for a 9-5 again, and mentally I I'm still recovering(I kind of forgot how to speak with people). With my credit I can't get my bank job back. I have this 10k hanging over me, a current credit card with a 4k balance, and a car loan. Because of this I am also not setting aside for taxes, which will be a problem later on, also a problem in two weeks when the property taxes are due on said car. I currently have $40 in my account.

2,personalfinance,FMLA Leave and Eligibility,"So I have an interesting situation and hope someone can shed a little light or give any advice. 

I've been a nanny for a family in OR since March 2021. I started out at part time and went to full time(40hrs/wk) in May. I had wanted to get on a payroll service with them as soon as I started but they were slow to go and had neither of us had gone through this before. I always planned on paying taxes on whatever I earned. 

I had them sign a nanny contract that states the generic guaranteed hours, pto, ect. In June, I found out I was pregnant and due in early March. This wasn't a planned pregnancy but it is a happy one!

My partner and I have budgeted for after the baby comes so I don't feel too stressed. However, the family I work for has been asking when I will take time off(I'm currently 4mo along). My plan was to go until 36 weeks and there's been talk of me coming back after 12 weeks and bringing my baby but no solid conversations.

This is where I need help. Today, the family asked for me to give them a date and I feel like I can give them one but since we are all a little uneducated on employer/employee rights and laws, I wanted to check and make sure I am prepared. Some of my nanny friends have maternity leave in their contracts and others have gotten FMLA through the state.

My questions are:

Oregon FMLA is for employees that have worked for 12 months. With my due date being ONE week away from my start date I fall at 51 weeks of employment. Am I automatically not qualified for leave?

I've been their employee since mid March 2021 but I didn't sign a W-2 until June although I kept track of all payments and hours and plan to pay taxes on it all. Will the state only look at my employment as starting in June? 

Am I completely out of luck on the leave front? 

Any help or advice would be great. I'm going to talk to the FMLA desk at the hospital at my next appt in a month.",1632279395

She used to work full time as a Dental Assistant, but stopped working due to her having a lot of nerve issues and carpal tunnel issues, to the point where she has gotten surgeries (and still needs some) So while on leave from work she's been getting unemployment (since just about before covid began) and that is all gone now.

14,personalfinance,Should I go to graduate school to change careers when I want to retire at 55?,"I’m 30 and my goal is to retire at 55. Currently I make $45K from my full time job and I make another $5K from my part time job (11ish hours a week). Part time job is not sustainable long term since I have zero days off as a result and do want more free time to relax or pursue other hobbies. I am planning to move out of my HCOL city to another HCOL city to be closer to my social circles since I don’t like where I live currently and career prospects here are terrible and are the anomaly amongst other HCOL locations. Wherever I retire will likely be HCOL.

I have been unable to job hop to a higher paying job and I’ve tried to internally transfer 6x in my company. I’ve been at my current role for 5 years. I have only gotten calls back for interviews for a small handful of jobs I’m overqualified for and that pay under $40K.  My major is a BS in business, finance, and marketing.

I am considering going to grad school for a career change to either computer science or human computer interaction (UI/UX) since my salary prospects are low with how little interviews I can get and my field is not interesting. I’m looking at programs in the UK since they are one year programs (most US ones are 2 years). Tuition for UK ones are $30-45K USD for either CS or HCI (UX). And living abroad experience is something I’m interested in doing in my lifetime. For US based options I’m looking at a $50K one year full time masters program in CS, a part time 2-3 year online masters in CS program for $25K, and a part time remote one year masters HCI program for $50K. I would also need to pay for my living.

Fortunately my parents offered to pay 50% of my tuition for grad school since I’ve been struggling with getting a better job.

I have zero debt and $240K invested (Roth IRA, 401k, and taxable brokerage account combined). My FIRE number may be around $2.2 million but it is not a set hard number since I think it will change. I am not married but plan to marry my SO in a few years, not sure about kids. I plan to FIRE on my own regardless if I’m married or not. So my FIRE number is for me only.

17,personalfinance,Stuck with a $3k medical bill when insurance denied coverage of dental device - can the dentist charge us if we don’t have the device?,"Posted a similar version of this a while back but this still hasn’t resolved. 

My husband has sleep apnea, and his doctor recommended going to a dentist to get fitted for a custom oral appliance that’ll ease the condition. The sleep doctor said his insurance should cover it. He then was referred to an in-network dentist, who read his sleep apnea sleep study and also said his insurance should cover the cost of the appliance. He called his health insurance (Aetna), and they again said it should be covered.

He then got the procedure done and had the oral appliance ordered. Paid $250 copay for the whole procedure. He hasn’t been to pick up the oral appliance because of covid. Then we got notified by the dentist that his insurance indeed will not cover the appliance because his sleep apnea diagnosis isn’t severe enough, as the insurance evaluated his diagnosis based on some different scale than what the doctor/dentist expected. The dentist did not obtain a pre-authorization for the procedure. The dentist’s appeal was also denied. We received a $3k bill. My husband then did a member appeal with Aetna. It was again denied.

We don’t have $3k sitting around gathering dust. If we had known his insurance was going to deny it, we would not have gotten this done as there are other cheaper options. Where do we go from here? 

The bill from the dentist is asking us for the cost of the oral appliance, which we HAVE NOT picked up due to this billing dispute and covid. We are not in possession of it. Ideally, since he hasn’t picked up the oral appliance, we hope he can just say he will not pick it up and won’t pay for it.

40,personalfinance,Help reinvesting tech equity,"Hi everyone,

Thank you so much in advance for any advice you might be able to lend. Here we go:

I'm 33, and recently came into a windfall of cash due to a tech company I used to work for going public in December (fine, it's Airbnb). I've sold about 25% of my stock (it's all long term cap gains) and am sitting with about $60k after taxes and \~$200k left in Airbnb stock. 

In April of this year, I invested $5k in VTSAX, $5k in VTIAX, and $17k in a Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolio account. 

While the market has taken a hit in the past couple days, I'd still say that none of the above long term accounts have netted me much in the past 5 months. VTSAX has me at a net gain of about $300, VTIAX is still at an even $5k, and the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio Account hasn't tipped above a net $400/500. 

Initially, I was hoping that the Schwab IPA would give me some exposure to bonds (going the Boglehead route alongside the two Vanguard mutual funds), but I just haven't seen healthy returns across the board. Maybe I'm just being impatient, but since the market has been hot for the past 12 months, I guess I was expecting better performance.

My question now is: Do I rebalance the money in my current portfolio, and 2) what should I do with $15k I have right now to invest in long term investments? 

I have enough set aside in my emergency fund, so that's not a concern.

Realistically I'd like my first house to be fairly modern (built within last 10 years), and have been keeping a price in my head of $350k-400k. With the above numbers, unless I utilize my retirement funds (borrow from myself or something), I probably won't have 20% down ($70k-80k) until around 2 years from now tbh.

My personal opinion/idea is to keep renting until like 28/29. I would spend this time renting and saving/investing, but also do occasional travel trips around the USA for a bit on some mini-vacations to get the feel of some areas where I might want to consider a long term living scenario and house/condo purchase.

My dad, especially in recent times after baring witness to the booming real estate markets, thinks I'm squandering my opportunities and time doing this. He recommends I drop 5-10% as down payment, accept PMI in my life, and start reaping the benefits of both the real estate market and gaining equity on a property.

I was aware of this going in, the *entire purpose* of the HELOC was to convert that debt.

Is there a specific, known threshold on a credit account whereby I would be able to know  for sure that if I paid off my balance to below that level, that reason for credit denial would not be something I'd have to watch out for when applying in the future?  I already knew my credit utilization was high, so going through the application process and subsequent credit check was just a big waste of time.

If I could know for sure that I'd need to say, pay off X amount of each balance so that I could then be approved for a HELOC, that would have been vastly more useful and saved everyone some time.

I am looking to make sure I am allocating money as best as possible. Should I contribute more in my company’s Roth account? Should I have less cash on hand? As far as financial goals, I truly do not have any which may be the problem.

To start I am 24 No spouse or kids with a bachelors making $54k + bonus a year. The bonus is anywhere between 3%-7% of gross and comes at year end. 

I set my direct deposit up to have $150 deposited in savings bi-weekly, then the rest in checking. 

My total savings is currently just over $13k. I also have my employer 401k set up to contribute 15% of my salary. My employer matches 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2%. Current balance is just $1300 (5 months in). To add to investments I set my own brokerage account to have automatic deposits from my checking bi-weekly of $100. This is through Schwab and has a balance of $36k. This is a combination of previous employer rollover in Roth and my own contributions from HS/college.

As a far as expenses go, I spend roughly $1200 on rent and utilities. Since I work from home I get gas maybe once a month. I do spend a lot as far I can tell on food roughly $350 a month. 

Also no debt

Excess Salary Election – You can defer between 1% and 30% of any year-to-date benefits eligible compensation in excess of the IRS Compensation Limit ($285,000 in 2020). Sanofi US Group will match the first 6% of excess compensation deferred into the VDCP.

77,personalfinance,What is your perception of the typical American financial life cycle?,"I know everybody and every situation is different, but if you had to describe the typical financial life cycle of an American Citizen, how would you describe it? And how does this differ from how it should be?

For example... Here's my idea of typical...

Birth through 18 or 20: You mooch off of your parents.

20 - 40: Your kids mooch off of you (turn-about is fair, right?)

40-65: Saving for retirement.

65-85: Living off of retirement savings.

Maybe this is typical, maybe it's not. I don't have data or research to back it up, it's just the idea stuck in my head about the way things are done.

The only thing I would really change would be that families should keep some kind of generational wealth, enough to live through retirement on dividends only, without selling shares. That way, when I die, my daughter, who will be about retirement age, can just inherit that retirement fund, add her own savings, live off the dividend like I did, and pass a bigger retirement fund to her kids to rinse and repeat.

I grew up in a middle class working family, and my family is middle class and working. I know people from wealthier or poorer backgrounds will have different pre-conceived ideas of what is normal, and that's what I'm really interested in. I want to know what differences there are in what people with different backgrounds think is normal.",1632265950
78,personalfinance,Where to put $30k cash for retirement?,"36M looking for advice on where to put $30k in cash. Currently making $172k/year.

$221k in retirement funds between Traditional IRA and employer 401k

$400k in stocks (mix of individual stocks and ETFs)

$20k in emergency funds (cash), and $30k just sitting there

1) If I want to put $30k (currently sitting in a high yield savings account) for retirement somewhere, are there any retirement vehicles where I would benefit from tax savings? From what I understand, traditional IRA seems like a no go because I would be double taxed. I also don't seem to quality for a Roth IRA? It's unclear if investing in stocks through my brokerage is better than through a retirement account.

2) If I have a Vanguard traditional IRA right now, is it possible to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard as well? Or a Roth IRA with another bank? From what I understand it seems like the answer is no?

I opened a Citigold checking account with a large balance to take advantage of a bonus they were offering. Giving them the money was easy. I'm learning now that getting it back is difficult.

They cap the ACH limits at 15k/month - which won't work... so I have two options.

* I can have a cashier's check made at a local branch and deposit it at my local bank (free)

I'd prefer not to do the wire - because I've never done one - and it's my understanding if in the very unlikely event I accidentally wire it to the wrong person (typo, etc) then it's gone.

I am happy to do the cashier's check - but my wife is concerned that a CTR report might get is in trouble somehow.

82,personalfinance,First-Time Homebuyer Regret? Can I afford it?,"I recently made an offer on a house I like, it has everything I want and it is in a nice neighborhood, I'm not sure why I feel this way. I'm worried that I rushed into it, especially because I'm offering about 10k above the asking price and I'm worried that I will most likely be living paycheck to paycheck to afford it or if something happens I wouldn't have enough in my savings to cover the repairs or damage in the future. 

Here is a breakdown of my finance. 

$60k a year, monthly income after taxes, healthcare benefits deduction is about $3.3k. I don't have any debts other than a credit card that I never go over $300. I paid off my student loans and I don't have any car payments.

My estimated monthly mortgage now is about $1320. 

My estimated monthly bills (internet, electricity, water, gas, security) are about $300, this is based on what I'm currently paying for bills, this could be higher or lower I honestly am just guessing at this point. 

Savings account 1: about 2k

Savings account 2: about 7k (I currently put about $540 a month into this account, but plan to reduce the number once I start paying the mortgage) 

Savings account 3: about 10k 

I have a separate retirement fund that's about 9k and an investment account of about $900. I put $500 into my retirement fund a month and about $260 into my investment account a month. 

I know I might be thinking too much into this but I want to get some advice about how I should break down my budget correctly.

85,personalfinance,Sell car to invest? Or sell stocks?,"I've stumbled upon a very good investment opportunity with an early-stage company that I have good enough reason to want to risk some money on it. I understand it's risky, that's the nature of any early-stage investment. But I've evaluated it thoroughly and feel it's worth a shot.

The minimum buy-in is $25k. 

While I have plenty of capital (about 150k in various index funds and stocks, plus healthy 401k), I'm currently pretty cash-poor (covid paycuts have wrecked my monthly cash flows), so to find the 25k, I have no liquid cash to pull from.

I do have a car that I own outright that I can sell for about 25k. If I did that, I'd immediately divert the proceeds into the new investment, and then take out a loan on a $10-$15k used car. On the other hand, it's a 2017 in great shape and fully paid off, so it's likely to be pretty trouble free for many years, with no car payments.

I have no other debt beyond a mortgage.

Alternatively, I can sell $25k worth of my stock and index fund portfolio. I'm hesitant to do that because I have about a 20 year time horizon on those investments — I'm planning to keep them long term, hoping to gain 6-12% interest.

So what are your thoughts on how to get the $25k—sell the car, or sell stock?",1632264869
86,personalfinance,Should I use Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or pay off faster on my own?,"Hoping to get some perspectives on if I should use PSLF to forgive some of my student loans or just keep paying on them. I have so far paid about $20k of my loans and have $53k left. I was paying for about 3 years at a job that was for profit. Right before the pandemic I started at a non-profit, that I hope to be at longer term. During the pandemic, I have been saving for putting one night chunk on my loans and expect to have about 13k and I did also apply for PSLF, so this time (since June 2020) will count towards the forgiveness. In terms of my overall financial picture,I am 30 yo, have no cc debt, only a car loan that is less than 1% interest, have a solid emergency fund, and have almost 40k in retirement investments. My pay is about 60k. 

My concern is about whether it will be worth it in the end to pay only the minimum and have the rest forgiven. My IBR has my payments set at $280 prepandemic. My income hasn’t changed drastically and I don’t expect it will. I anticipate that most of my raises will be small, cost of living type raises for the position/field I am in. However, I do hope to meet a partner and get married within the next 9 years and have no idea how that would impact my IBR. If I were to keep paying the minimum as it’s set now, I would pay about $30k over 9 years, which obviously would be financially better than paying off the entire $53k+ that is left with interest and all. However, I feel uncertain about how my IBR payments might change over time? I’ve of course also heard the many stories of people for whom PSLF has not worked out due to red tape reasons. Obviously continuing to have loans is also something that just doesn’t feel good for me, but I want to do what will leave me most likely to pay less overall.

I purposefully did not use my new card for ANY online purchases or payments, including updating any automatic payments (I wrote old school checks for my bills that week).

After working my way up through Apple service call lines it has been confirmed that they DO NOT take account and routing numbers, only cards. So how did my bank allow those charges to process when Apple didn’t have the correct card information?

My grandmother recently passed away and named all her grandchildren (me included) as beneficiaries of her traditional IRA; my share should be around $56,000. I really want to not bother my family about any of this, as everyone's still processing the loss.

All my savings are invested in VG index funds, and I'd really like to do this on my own - but my grandmother's former financial adviser really stressed the tax consequences of not withdrawing correctly from these funds, so two questions:

1. Has anyone found helpful resources on beneficiary IRAs they would vouch for? The ones I've found tend to end with some version of, ""Sign up with our company so an adult handles this!""
2. Be honest - would you recommend someone with limited financial experience handle this on their own?  I balance my own portfolio of stock and bond index funds, which has gone quite well, but I'm not as confident in my tax knowledge.

Current situation: I just turned 20. I've been working for a few months now, have \~2000$ saved so far. My current job makes me \~2k a month, and I have two guaranteed roommates also my age (potentially a third, though im not counting on it) who each make slightly more than I to split bills with, for a combined monthly income of around \~6500$.  
\- I have a checking and savings account, but no credit card yet, so I don't think I have any established credit. I would need to check with them to see if they have any credit.  
\- I live in central California, so the housing market is less than ideal around here. A typical three-bed, two-bath house can cost upwards of 400K here (where a similar house would rarely cost above 200k in other states, I've looked).   


Renting is on the table, but seeing as a mortgage is not only cheaper per month, but also equity-building, I would greatly prefer to buy.

  
What I have been considering is purchasing a HUD foreclosed home; I have found homes in the size we need (3 bed 2 bath) in our area as cheap as 80,000$. I know there's a reason these houses are so cheap; however, we're not so concerned about how fancy the house is as long as it's a roof over our heads that we won't need to pump money into constantly just to keep it from collapsing.

1. How much should I ask from Current Company to help them out? My current rate is $27hr, full-time, in Alabama.

2. How long should I plan to be available for? They're posting the opening today but their hiring principles mean they often take a long time to hire new folks. They're also penny-pinchers so I know if I give them an indefinite term length, they'll keep asking for my services indefinitely as long as it's cheaper than hiring someone full time.

17,personalfinance,Is there any compelling reason not to max out a HELOC every month?,"I just made a payment on my HELOC again, as I do every month, and I realized that right after I made the payment, my available credit bumped up a notch on the web banking page.  

It occurred to me today that it seems to make little sense to not have this line of credit maxed out while paying higher interest rates on other debts.  Right now my financial priority is a 9.9% construction loan, then 7.9% and 6.8% student loans.  My HELOC, at 3.74%, is really my dead last priority to pay down/off.

Anyway, I still have a checkbook on this line, and I think it will remain in a revolving status for another two or three years.  Wouldn't it make at least mathematical sense for me to use the entire available balance of the HELOC to make a payment on one of my other debts after paying the minimum every single month?  

I haven't done this before because I've been wary of maxing it out just in general, but also because I like keeping some available credit on it to supplement my emergency fund.  However, right now I just keep looking at the interest I'm paying every month on all my other debts and it seems to me that increasing my payment on another debt by about the same amount as my HELOC payment would help me pay down that debt a little faster.  

I'm doing the one where you pay in order of interest rate, for the most part - which is kind of frustrating because right now I have several small accounts that are smaller than my savings account balance, but each is currently at a much lower rate than my student loans so I have to put the extra money to the costlier balances first.  

The only reason I ask is because it seems intuitive that you shouldn't keep a credit line maxed out while you are trying to get out of debt, but it also seems logical to me that, as this line is at a very affordable interest rate, it makes sense not just to only pay the minimum on it but to effectively pay even less by ratcheting the balance back up after each payment.  It just feels... I don't know, kind of sleazy to draw a check taking out the last $200 of a $50,000 credit line, especially to consider intentionally doing so month after month.",1632259753

I'm 23 and a recent college grad. I'm making 60k a year at my current position and have just over 44k in student loans. The loan has a 4.07% interest rate. I have an emergency fund set up and continue to save 10% of what I make as well as invest 10% into my retirement accounts while also making the minimum payments.

Outside of my retirement accounts and emergency fund, I have roughly 17k sitting in a taxable investment account that was saved over the pandemic. Up until yesterday I had understood that making the minimum payment on loans below ~5% and investing extra money was mathematically advantageous, so that's what I've been doing. However I have been debating whether or not I should put the 17k against the balance of my loan to lower my overall debt as well as give me a better debt/income ratio for when I'm ready to buy a house/property.

I think it would be advantageous to lower the debt faster so that I can speed up saving for a down payment once the bill is gone.

37,personalfinance,"Seeking advice on reducing mortgage payments by extending duration of the loan. Good, bad or depends on situation?","Apologies in advance for a wall of text!

I am 35 and my wife is 31. We currently earn $180k/per annum combined. Both of us max out our 401Ks and we are also currently fully funding our ROTH IRAs as well. We have both been able to live a very simple lifestyle and save a little over 50% of our incomes for the last few years.

We recently (June 2020) bought a $315K house where we put down 20% and financed the remaining balance with a 20-year mortgage @ 2.99% (great rate, not complaining) and we are in general easily able to make mortgage payments while still saving and investing. Our budget so far allows us to not only max out our tax advantaged accounts, but also have left over to invest through a taxable brokerage account.

Now, we are expecting a child soon and we need to figure out day care costs and all that fun stuff. Day care is probably going to be anywhere between $1-1.5k/month. Budgeting for this should be fine since we do have an emergency fund set aside (1-year worth), so it might be ok to divert cash savings/month towards this expense. But, I was wondering if re-financing our mortgage to a 30 year one would make sense? This would reduce our mortgage payments by almost $400-500/month. This savings could not only help us pay for day care, but it would also mean that we would NOT need to sacrifice our ongoing monthly taxable investment contributions (of course at the cost of paying more interest on the loan). The plan here would be to make the lower payments/ month until our child does not need day care anymore, after which we can revert back to making large mortgage payments like it was a 20-year loan.

Does this financially make sense, or should we just leave the mortgage alone and continue on? On the one hand I can see how it would make sense to pay off a house aggressively, but on the other I am worried that our “extra” investments outside of tax advantage accounts may dwindle.

I currently have a 401K with a balance of 127,600 with 2 outstanding loans currently outstanding $26,143

Loan one @ 13491 
Loan two @ 12652

I’ve run into a situation where I don’t have a good option to get financing outside of brutal 20% APR personal loans and wanted to look at paying off a loan to open a new one up to access the funds I need.

Vanguard for some reason can’t help me confirm what I would be looking at and I’m concerned how this should look. 

The IRS says “In determining the plan maximum amount in that case, the $50,000 is reduced by the difference between the highest outstanding balance of all of the participant’s loans during the 12-month period ending on the day before the new loan and the outstanding balance of the participant’s loans from the plan on the date of the new loan.”

For me that would mean the calculation if I closed loan 2 to be: 

50,000 - (32,500-13,491) = 30,991 

32,500 being my rough estimate based on quarterly statement from 1Yr prior as my highest outstanding balance 

Vanguard was giving me a number around 23,800 which seems much like simply 50,000- my 2 loan outstanding balance, and I then got someone on the line who said it may be 17,500 (sounds like 50,000- 1Yr outstanding balance of 32500)

It has been almost 90 days (without actually looking at a calendar) since and I have not received anything. I have spoken with the agency and they told me they were sorry and were working on returning my deposit or whatever was left of it after expenses. However, they stated the pet deposits were listed as non-refundable originally and they were trying to adjust that so that the pet deposits would be refunded alongside the traditional deposit refund. The issue is the accounting software does not allow that to happen - so they have stated they would need to be in contact with the company that provides that software to have that changed which has been the case for almost a month now.

That's basically the whole story so far, but my texts have not been returned for two weeks now and I'm looking for guidance on proceeding to get my money back. Like I said my state offers almost zero renters protection against landlords, but I'm positive my signature/initials are on documents that state that I am entitled to receipt 60 days after vacating for what my deposit was used for if that were to be necessary for property.

57,personalfinance,(US) Property Taxes Doubled in 1 year on a Condo? Illinois Resident,"Hi everyone,

Issue: 
My parent's own a Condo in Illinois (USA) that had its property taxes literally double last year from approx 1.1k/yr to 2.2k/yr. 

Question: 
Is this normal? If not, what can be done to have someone look into it?

Basics: 
We were first alerted to this issue last year when their mortgage company noticed a deficit in our Escrow which caused my parent's monthly mortgage to jump from $695/month to nearly $1000/month. 

When we spoke to their mortage company about it LAST september, they told us it was due to an increase in property taxes. They said it could go back to its previous levels upon reassessment this September. Well, September is here today and they were right, the monthly payment for my parents will go down from the current $915/month to a paltry $908/month. COOL!

Why would property taxes double? This is the first time we've ever seen this happen. Any insight, friends?",1632252770

I'm pretty new to investment and would like to invest a bit into either the iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF (IAGG) OR the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF Shares BNDX, but I'm having trouble finding comparisons online Gooling round.

I know that wallstreetphysician seemed to prefer IAGG (in an article that was linked to me on this subreddit previously: [*https://www.wallstreetphysician.com/three-fund-portfolio-using-schwab-index-funds-etfs/*](https://www.wallstreetphysician.com/three-fund-portfolio-using-schwab-index-funds-etfs/)), but I'm not really sure I'm correctly understanding how the funds differ.

Is it just that IAGG invests more in China than BNDX? Looking at the past 5 year graphs it does look as though IAGG has been slightly less volatile, but I might be missing something.

Anyhow just trying to decide before putting the money down. My plan right now is to do the following:  
1) Schwab US Broad Market ETF (55%)  
2) Schwab International Equity ETF (30%)  
3) Schwab US Aggregate Bonds ETF (10%)

64,personalfinance,Simple Payoff Calculation Question,"Say I want to install solar.

This is ignoring inflation, electric bill price hikes and so on.

That makes sense. But suppose I take out a loan with a monthly payment of $126.53 (4.5% APR for 20 years). Now the breakeven point is at 22 years and 6 months. Yet my monthly savings -  loan payment = $98.47 in savings per month. 

If I move after I'm done with the loan (20 years) the investment technically never paid off. However, I was going to pay my electric bill anyway ($100). After the loan is done the monthly savings are $23,632.

72,personalfinance,Should my wife get a cheaper car?,"So basically my wife bought a car \~2 years ago for 20k, it's a 2014 Rav4 with currently 100k miles and she pays $422/mo (including insurance which is $192).

77,personalfinance,Home buying but in an uncommon position,"
To start, my wife and I are both uncomfortable making large financial decisions. For example, until earlier this year we've only ever purchased cheap used cars with cash. We bought our first new car earlier this year due to needing a reliable mode of transportation. 

My wife and I are your typical nearly-30 millennials: Went to college, got the 4-year STEM degree, and have been working ever since. She has five years of experience, and I have four. However, in June of last year we both quit our jobs and moved into a camper to travel for eight months. While doing that, neither of us held a job or had any income. While it was an absolute blast, we grew tired of living in the camper and decided to rejoin society. She got a job that she held for four months or so making about 72K, and I was hired on in my field where I'm making 53.5K, but with the possibility of an annual bonus of up to 20% depending on company performance. My wife hated her job, so she quit and moved to a position where she currently makes about 43K a year. She's looking to get back into her field, but isn't having much success at the moment.

We have about 50K in liquid savings, and will probably have another 40K or so later this year once the camper is sold. Combined yearly income would be around 97K (107K if my bonus counts). That works out to 8K in monthly income between the two of us. Monthly recurring debts are 80 - student loans, 340 - Car payment, 1560 - rent. 

We are interested in buying a house, but we can't get any definitive answers from lenders about whether or not we would even qualify. I've never bought a house before, and I don't know anyone who's purchased a house later than the 1980's, so their experience isn't really relevant to the process today. I'm finding the process very overwhelming, and it doesn't help that no one in the business wants to help unless you're ready to buy a house tomorrow. 

When we ask lenders about qualifying, explaining our situation, all they tell us is ""apply for approval"" in order to find out. But we're not in a position to buy until winter at the earliest, and I'm hesitant because the housing market is still pretty hot where we're located. Average time on the market is only a week, and even the cheapest houses an hour away from the metro area (where our jobs are) are in the mid-high 300's. Not only is this higher than I'd like to spend, but it's also nearly 60% higher than area prices were a year and a half ago. So I'm hoping that supply will continue to increase and, while maybe prices won't come down, cheaper houses might come on the market. I don't like the idea of applying, taking the hit to our credit, and being denied for the work history gap. I'd think that they could let us know that it's a disqualifier without going through the full approval process.

So should we:
A) Apply now to see if we even qualify?
B) Wait until we're ready (due to market &amp; personal finance reasons), then apply?
C) Continue paying our exorbitant rent, living relatively frugally, and saving. Hopefully in 10 years or so we can grow our wealth to the point that we can afford a 1.2 million dollar starter house.",1632249979

My risk: I’m planning to buy an additional home. A vacation home close to the water and renting it out for at least half the year with what I can tell is a 60-250k short term rental income. I wish to transition from nursing to this as a full time career option. The homes cost in range from 600k-35 million. I’m assuming a 1.2 million $ home would provide the right attraction for renters in high season. I live with my fiancé who is a pediatric doctor currently salaried at 220k/year. I just put all my savings into a crypto asset hoping to help with my down payment for a home. 

I have some minor support by friends and family but descriptively state that it may be safer to buy a city home and rent that for a small profit. However for me, that’s a slow pay off of the mortgage, small profit, and the stress of a consistent renter seems daunting.  I prefer the vacation home since it could take between 5-10 years to pay it off and then becomes either complete profit or I own an appreciating vacation home.

I told him that’s insane and asked to look at his bill. He just pays through auto pay so he never paid it much attention.  Sure enough, he’s still being charged for a phone $33/month. 

So we go into the pink carrier’s store and the guy working the counter said that he had the same problem. Turns out there was a system glitch where after the phone was paid off, it turned that into a “phone rental” fee and still kept charging their customers. It’s apparently really widespread. 

So he called customer care and it was known that it was an issue, but they aren’t going back through to fix the bills, they only do it when you call and complain.  Turns out he has been paying for 16 months on a phone that was paid off. 

So what happened is that they marked the phone as paid off. They gave him a $20 discount for 12 months and then gave him a $600 credit towards a new device.

On the rent alone, some quick math says that paying for a mortgage, insurance, property taxes, repair savings, and PMI would be the cheaper than renting. We'd also save money by leaving the city but it's hard to quantify exactly how much.
* I personally believe that, while housing prices are at an all time high right now, the low interest rates make it appealing to buy now. Housing prices might be slightly cheaper in the future, but those savings would be less than the additional mortgage cost as interest rates increase.

So for these reasons we decided to start saving for a house. Our current lease ends in June, so we'd like to move next summer or fall. We are trying to save 3.5% for a house down payment as soon as possible, plus another 3.5% for closing costs. The houses we are looking at are $400k, so we'd need $28k cash for the down payment and the closing costs. We would like to do this without taking any money from our savings accounts.

Each month we currently save:

$1000 - Roth IRA (maxed)
$1230 - 401(k) (neither of us get a match FYI)
$428 - ""Known unknown"" Savings (unexpected vet bills, medical expenses, car expenses, etc)
$0 - ""Unknown unknowns"" emergency fund (stopped after reaching 6 month goal)
$1200 - House downpayment

Our balances currently look like:

$6k - Roth IRA
$20k - 401(k)
$4k - ""Known unknown"" Savings
$30k - ""Unknown unknowns"" emergency fund (6 months worth of expenses)
$0 - House down payment (just starting now)

The amount we currently are saving for the down payment isn't enough for the down payment and closing costs in the timeframe we are hoping for. However if we stopped putting money into the 401(k) for a year then it would be easy to do so. Since we don't get any matching we wouldn't be leaving money on the table by doing this.

I've already done research and people generally believe that 1 year isn't a long time to skip retirement savings, especially if it's being used for a house which can decrease living expenses after retirement. The problem is that we're already behind the standard ""1x gross annual salary by age 30"" rule of thumb. Based on our current balances, if we funnelled all 401(k) contributions into the house for 12 months then switched back to the schedule I outlined in the first table above, we wouldn't reach the ""1x gross annual salary"" goal until we are 32.",1632246531

98,personalfinance,Which Job Offer is the Right Choice?,"Sort of stuck in an odd situation. I have already accepted a job offer with Company A and am set to start on the 27th. I was working at one of the Big 4 in a specialized tax tech group through the 15th. Back in late July/early August I began interviewing with numerous companies and was ready to make my exit from public accounting. Both positions are with banks and have a focus on process improvements related to tax, financial reporting, financial audits, investor relations, etc. mixed in with the other day-to-day responsibilities of each. Company B certainly has a stronger focus on the tech/automation aspect. I get very interested in two companies (Company A and Company B) and decided to focus on them and fast forward to late August when Company A offers me a job after 2 rounds of interviews (4 in total, this seemed relatively normal). I like the offer and the position and am given 72 hours to make a decision. Given that I have the offer in hand and my chances of landing the other job with Company B were relatively low (I'd thought at least), the fact that I'd need to go through at least 2 more rounds of interviews (9 interviews total for this position), and that the job with Company A had a better WLB, I accepted the offer as I did not want to lose it and was pretty miserable in my last role and have been working many hours since I started working about 4 years ago. A few weeks later in early September Company B asks me to come in again for the next two rounds of interviews and I decided to since I really don't have anything to lose and an actual offer from them still seemed like a long shot. Surprisingly, I found out yesterday that they would like to extend me an offer. The dilemma stems from the fact that Company B (and I thought there would be pretty much zero chance they would comply with the request) is offering me 30k more than Company A (roughly 95k vs 125k). This is partially negated by the fact that I'd be working probably 65 hours per week at Company B and roughly 45-50 (very occasionally more and sometimes less) at Company A, but I would also likely have slightly better exit opportunities leaving Company B than I would be leaving Company A. Money is certainly not an issue for my wife and I, but it would make having children and owning a home in the future much easier. Now the dilemma comes in as I have unexpectedly received a job offer I did not expect or think I had any shot at, along with the whole issue of reneging on an offer you have already accepted. Given everything above, what is the best choice objectively and for my future?",1632245783

When I clicked on the link it only provided me a way to make a payment but I had no way of looking at a bill to see what the services were actually for. I did not want to enter my credit card number, because I was not certain whether or not this charge was valid. There was a phone number given in the email and I tried to call it multiple times that day but did not reach anyone. I finally left a message asking someone to call me back. I never received a return call. Today in the mail I received a letter from a collection agency attempting to collect for the same bill.

I guess I was assuming that if the bill was legitimate I would hear something further about what it was for. 

Upon receiving the letter from the collection agency today, I called the company the bill was originally from. I did finally reach someone and they were able to tell me the bill was related to an MRI I had several months ago. I believe the charge is legitimate. They said that a statement was mailed to my previous address, but I never received it, possibly because of it being sent during the time I was moving.

27,personalfinance,My parents are kicking me out of the house abruptly this month and I don't know how to survive financially,"My parents and I live in a very rural town where there aren't even any Ubers available.

I have a boyfriend that my parents are strongly against for minor personal reasons. He lives in a slightly bigger college town an hour away because he still has two years left in college.

My parents have blocked all access to transportation for me to step outside of the house even if it is to go to the pharmacy to pick up my medicine. This has been going on for three months.

They have security cameras on each door of the house and they watch my every move.

Things escalated two days ago when I still refused to break up with my boyfriend and now my mother has officially cut ties with me as her kin and is telling me to pay her $500 per month now to be able to live in my room and I am not allowed to utilize any other area of the house. I must pay $50 each time I use their car to go to job interviews and I am also required to vacuum the entire house including the basement and attic every morning.

I want to just move into my boyfriend's place where the rent is also $500 but while my boyfriend was for this plan at first, he is now worried because if I move out of this house my mother is cutting me off from the family health insurance and phone plan and I'll be a literal homeless person for an indefinite period of time and if an accident were to happen unexpectedly there is no solution. My boyfriend is also pointing out the reality that a job search is already hard when you have your own car, and in this town it's very difficult to go to places when you don't have one.

I finished my Bachelor's degree this summer and this period of time is very sensitive because this is the one year that would make or break my career. It's so stressful that my parents are putting me through a whirlwind at the worst possible time. I was preparing for my GRE exam coming up this Thursday in hopes of starting a Master's degree program next year but now it seems my life is falling apart and I'll be stuck in minimum wage jobs for the next year.

Even if I break up with my boyfriend my mother will enforce her rules on me and not take me back as her daughter.

She is very upset because she thinks that I am choosing my boyfriend over her and does not understand that both my mother and my boyfriend are people that I love and I want to be able to keep both in my life.

My boyfriend was the first human being in my entire life who emotionally connected with me and supported me.

I lived most of my life in this small rural town doing house chores for my parents until I decided to ask them if I could transfer into a bigger 4-year university. I think they do love me but they never emotionally connected with me. I have never received a hug from my parents during my entire life.

My boyfriend is like a ray of sunlight in my life and he is set on making this work out and is refusing to break up with me also but he's very concerned and worried that if I move out to rashly I'll end up homeless and he won't be able to do much because he's also just a college student who barely has a dollar to his name.

He thinks I should live alongside my parents as quietly as possible just until I actually have a solid job offer somewhere but the atmosphere of my home is suffocating to me and I can't focus on anything being here because I am so anxious that they will hurt me further.

I don't have any credit history because my parents always blocked me from signing up for a credit card.

I only have $216 in my pocket that I am thinking of using to borrow a UHaul truck when I move my stuff to my boyfriend's place.

I feel like I can make things work and go to my GRE exam and pay for the application fees for graduate schools on my own by finding two temporary part time jobs that hire within a week.

While I work those jobs I would continuously apply for at least 10 jobs related to my major every day.

But my boyfriend is asking me to focus more on thinking than feeling.

Is my plan unrealistic? 

I can't call the police and I have no way to contact a therapist.

All I have is myself. What do I do?

TL;DR My parents are charging me $500 per month to live in my room when I have no job and they want me to move out by January somehow. What do I do?",1632241691
28,personalfinance,Should I Purchase a Second Home?,"I purchased my first home in November of 2020. I bought a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house nearish to a medium-sized city with the intent to live with a roommate. He lived with me for about 9 months and has recently moved out. I can afford the mortgage with my current salary (it's slightly below 30% of my pre-tax monthly income) but it's just too much house for one person. The market in my city is ""cooling"" according to my real estate agent and I have been thinking of downsizing into a smaller home and renting this one out. 

The mortgage in this house is approximately $1900 per month and according to Redfin/Zillow I could rent it out for $2600 per month. Realistically I think I might get $2400 if I put it on the rental market. It's a fairly nice home, needs some updating but no major flaws. 

I've got about $70k sitting in my bank account which is about what I had when I put down 5% to purchase this house. My thought process is as follows: If I spend the winter in this house doing cosmetic fix ups and making the yard nice, then in the Spring I could potentially rent this place out and find a smaller house. I would make some extra income from renting out this home and then save $400 per month with a smaller, cheaper house with a lower mortgage that is small enough for one person. I really like living alone I'm coming to find out, and I don't want to sell this place since I got a fairly good deal on it and I do genuinely like it. 

Basically, I'm trying to get out of the habit of just sitting on money and letting it do nothing. Does anyone have any advice on this front?

31,personalfinance,Need advice/insight about an offer from my mom,"Some backstory:

My mother owns two houses - one that she lives in with her husband, and a house that she owned before they got together. Mom has decided that she wants to sell the house - it's a hot market, she has quite a bit of equity built up, and she doesn't want to continue maintaining two properties. 

Here's the offer:

**My mom offered to sell my husband and me the house for below market value, depending on how much we can get pre-approved for (option A). If we don't buy the house, she's going to sell it for full price and give us $50K out of the proceeds from the sale (option B).** 

My first instinct was to select option A, but after mulling it over for a couple of days and thinking about our current financial situation, I think I may be leaning more toward option B. My husband and I talked it over the day my mom presented the offer and he also leaned more toward option A, but I'm not sure if that's because it's the option we explored the most and the one I was leaning towards at that time. As this is a gift from my mother, he said that the final decision is up to me, but I still want to make the best decision for our team and not just the best decision for me.

Some background about our finances/life stuff at the moment:

* Husband doesn't have much debt, just his car and a little bit of CC debt.
* I have \~$27K in federal student loans as well as some CC debt.
* My car is paid off and I work from home, but I'm looking for a better-paying job so I may end up having to commute again. If this happens, I'll potentially need to get a new car as mine is a 2002. If I don't have a new car by the time we have a kid, I'll need to get one then for safety reasons.
* Speaking of kids - husband and I have been trying for 4 years, and have had 4 losses in that time. We still owe \~$2000 for the last one. We're switching fertility doctors and are going to pursue more testing, which will of course cost money and may not be covered by our insurance.
* We are currently renting my grandmother's second house for well below market value in our town. A mortgage + home insurance + taxes might be as much or more per month than what we're currently paying in rent. There is very little chance of my grandmother ever selling the house so it's unlikely that we'll have to find new housing until we're ready to move. It's a good size for the two of us (and our pets), but if we have a kid it will be cramped.
* We do not have much in savings (less than $3K). We had some financial difficulties earlier this year and our savings took a big hit. Buying a house with so little savings seems a bit like sky-diving without a parachute.

And a note about my mom/the house:

She owes $50K on the mortgage and wants to have $75K in hand after she sells that house, so her minimum selling price for us would be $125K. But considering that the last house in her neighborhood that sold netted closer to $200K, that would be taking money out of her pocket (far more than $50K). This is my mom's post-divorce, independent woman house. She has worked hard her entire life and I want her to make all the money she can from the sale of the house so she can enjoy the fuck out of her retirement. We're going to get it appraised but I think we'd end up buying it for $150-175K.

**Pros of Option A (buying the house)**

* Husband and I would be homeowners, something that has felt increasingly out of reach the past couple of years and is only getting worse. I worry that this may be our own chance to own a home.
* We would immediately have equity in the house. Our town is a hot market and property values are only rising. We could likely sell it in a few years and make more than $50K.
* We wouldn't have to search for a house, get into a bidding war, pay closing costs, etc. Home-buying made easy.

**Cons of Option A**

* We'd add to our debt. My student loans feel like an anchor and cause me stress/anxiety - I can't imagine what adding a mortgage would do to that. 
* The financial implications of buying a home may set us back on other goals - having a kid, paying off debt, buying a safer/more reliable car for me. I'm not sure if buying a house when we already have stable, affordable housing should be our main priority right now.
* We're not 100% sure we want to stay in the town we're currently living in, and buying a house is a HUGE root to put down.

**Pros of Option B (taking the $50K)**

* $50K would wipe our debt slate clean AND leave us with a decent nest egg to accomplish our other goals. $27K to pay off my student loans, and then we'd have $23K to pay off husband's car, have an emergency fund, and put away the rest as a down payment.
* A significant amount of our income is used to pay off debt, and without it, we'd be able to save more as well. More of our money would be OURS. 
* Not having to live with the sword of Damocles of hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt owed to multiple institutions (mortgage, new car, student loans). We've both been struggling with our mental health lately and an easing of our financial burdens would be a huge relief.
* This would net my mom more money as well.

**Cons of Option B**

* It would be a one-time payment of $50K, whereas buying the house could turn into more than that if/when we sell it. I'm worried that this option may have more short-term benefits but might not be the better decision in the long-term, especially if home prices continue to rise.

34,personalfinance,Questions about 401k vs. Roth allocation,"When I was younger, my grandfather opened me up a Roth IRA, and put some money away in it. When I graduated college, I opened up a 401k, and have been contributing to that for the last few years (employer match, for the win!).  


I just changed jobs, and my current job doesn't provide a 401k match. I've been trying to read up on contribution limits, but honestly am quite confused and not sure what to do. I was wondering if you could help:  


1. My employer offers a 401k, and I have an IRA from my last few jobs, and that Roth IRA. I'm assuming I should contribute to either the 401k or the Roth - what allocation should I use between them? Or can I contribute to them both? If I can, I'd max them both out.
2. I live in the Bay Area, so although my base salary is high, post tax it's below the 120k MAGI limit. I haven't been able to figure out if that means my contributions are capped - MAGI has been confusing.
3. Every time I changed jobs I'd rollover my 40k into a traditional IRA. It seems like this is unnecessary, and I should probably have all my money in one place. Is there any reason I should keep all three accounts?

35,personalfinance,Deferred Comp/401(k) over match vs. Saving for Down Payment,"Our family is weighing options for what to do with our excess money for the next two years. Family of four with two young children. Both adults (mid-30s) have VERY stable jobs. Only debt is current mortgage at 3.5%. No credit debt, no student loan debt, both cars are bought and paid for. Emergency fund is secure in savings account. I am a government employee, so I contribute to a pension. My wife contributes to her 401(k) up to the employer match. We also each have fully funded Roth IRAs. We are doing well and want to do the right thing with $$ we are sitting on.

We plan to move to a new house in 2023. We will be selling our current house that will be turning a sizeable profit and paying that mortgage off. I see three options for what to do with extra money until that time.

A - Hold on to it to make a large down payment on the new house. We would love to put 30% down, but will certainly be putting 20% down. If we go with this option, should we do anything with it other than leave it in the savings account?

B - My wife contributes up to the max in her 401(k). Employer match ends at 3%, but we could just sock it away in there for retirement. 

C - The state has a deferred compensation plan that I am somehow just now hearing about. Can I participate in the pension, the deferred comp plan AND still contribute to my Roth IRA? I'm confident in the first two, but I'm not sure how my independent Roth plays into this, if at all. But this would also be a possibility for the money.

What do you think? Save it for a down payment in two years for our forever home, or push it into some combination of my wife's not-matched 401(k) and my deferred comp plan (if I even can with already having a Roth IRA.)",1632240635

39,personalfinance,Filing a renters insurance claim-- not sure what to do or where to begin?,"Hi!   
I am renting in a city and recently a wall in a breezeqay next to my house collapsed. We were evacuated Sunday morning and the building is currently condemned and being inspected. As soon as this happened (Sunday) I filed for renters insurance and it went into effect the next day (Monday).   


We had to get a hotel last minute, and because we had limited time to grab personal belongings prior to the building being closed off, we will probably have to buy some new items that we forgot in the heat of the moment (such as clothes, toiletries, scrubs (I work in healthcare) ).  I have been in touch with my landlord but currently, there is no timeline on when I can move back into my apartment, though she said her contractor said it is likely I will be able to move back. 

I have a couple of questions about what to do next?   
1. Would my claim be denied because I recently purchased the insurance // is there a specific way to file the claim that it can be accepted? I anticipated this would be an issue and purchased our hotel with 2 different reservations. The latter reservation was set to start the date the insurance went into effect on Monday. There are multiple news articles about the event happening on Sunday, however. 

2. Should I wait until the situation is over to file a claim or is there an opportunity to file an ongoing claim? We are a bit tight on money having to get a hotel last minute in the city + cover potential costs for belongings we did not have time to gather. Do I put all purchases on a credit card for now and hopefully use the reimbursement to pay it back?

44,personalfinance,"FAANG job offer; noncompete clause at current job is applicable, but requires payout to enforce","So, I am faced with a pretty unique situation here and that I'm hoping to get feedback on.  A little over four weeks ago, I started a new position with a total compensation of around $185k. The company is a startup, so there are some equity awards in addition to that (roughly $30k based on current valuation), but as the company has no firm exit in place yet, I'm not including these in the calculation.  During my job search, I had also applied to a job at a FAANG company, which finally came back around and made me a job offer today.  Total compensation on this one is around $280k (the difference being 100% RSUs).  However, I have just noticed that the FAANG company has one product that is a direct competitor to my current company's product, and so taking this job would be in violation of the non-compete agreement that I have signed with my current company.  There is one additional wrinkle here, in that I am a resident of Massachusetts, and so my current employer was forced to put in a provision on the non-compete that says that in order for the company to enforce the non-compete, they have to pay me the equivalent of one half of my base salary (half of $160k = $80k annually) for the period that the provision is in effect (1 year, in this case).  The employer has 7 days from the day that I resign to decide if they wish to enforce that provision and can opt out during this period.  If they don't opt out during this period, then they have to pay me $80k, and I can't work at a company that is a direct competitor for one year.  Note that most other companies in my field of work would not be in violation of the non-compete clause as they have no directly competing product to my current company.

So, it looks like there is a path to actually accepting the FAANG job legitimately, and I'm trying to decide if it is worth pursuing.  Basically, it hinges upon the fact that my current employer isn't likely to want to pay $80k to enforce a non-compete provision on an employee who just started.  Looking at all of the possible outcomes, I came up with a rough estimation for probabilities of various outcomes if I were to to go for the FAANG job:  


Possibility 1: I resign from my current company and they opt out of enforcing the non-compete.  Estimated probability 90%.  New compensation $280k.  


Possibility 2:  I resign from current company and they opt to enforce the non-compete.  Estimated probability 10%.  New compensation dependent upon ability to get another job.  Worst case scenario, I get $80k and struggle to find another job (let's say 3% probability).  Best case scenario, I either get another well paid job plus $80k (6% probability), or I use that time to start a successful business (1% probability).

Alternative 1:  These two above possibilities are compared with the alternative of staying at my current  position.  Compensation \~$185k.

There are also some other concerns, such as the burning of bridges with my current employer, and the how much I would like either job (they are both remote, and I neither strongly like nor dislike my coworkers in either company).  But mostly, I think this boils down to a salary question and whether it is  worth the small risk of my current employer choosing to enforce the non-compete and then me struggling to find another job, for the much more likely benefit of getting a pretty significant pay bump.",1632239811

They ended up actually closing  my account in the same month, which was weird but I didn't mind. 

The problem was that when I was trying to get the funds back that i deposited from my other checking account they said that it would be mailed back to me in the form of a check and that i should receive it it 30-60 days.

Okay no problem - but April i still haven't received anything and I call again and they said that the closure wasn't processed and that I need to wait another 30-60 days to receive the check with my funds.

Come June I still haven't received anything so I call again and again they tell me the same thing and to wait 30-60 days.

In July I finally receive something, but there was no check. Instead it was a document saying that there is $0 in the account now.

So I call again wondering whats going on and they said that the account has finally been processed for closure and that a check would come in the next 30 days or so.

Come August i still haven't received anything and call again and they said again that it should come in the middle of September.

Nothing came and when I called again today and they basically told me that no money was owed to me based on their investigation and that's why I haven't received anything. I explained to them that I have statements with the deposits from my other checking account but to them it was useless information. When I asked where my money went since it didn't come back to me, they said it went to some sub ledger and when I asked what that meant they couldn't explain it at all and instead sent me on another wild goose chase through customer service that lead to a dead end. 

Imagine my face when dealing with this saga for 7 months to get told that the money I originally deposited and hadn't touched since the initial deposit was now gone and not owed to me.

I already filed complaints with FDIC and CFPB in the beginning of August, but that essentially did nothing.

I haven't had access to these funds for 7 months now and need it to pay bills and such. I'm at my wits end and was wondering if any of you guys know if there is anything else I can do about this situation and get my money back because Citi is basically ignoring me at this point.

51,personalfinance,Optimizing the car decision - family of 5,"Morning.  Curious for some outside perspective on the perfect 2 car pair for my situation.  We currently have a 2016 Sienna with 39k miles, and a 2007 Avalanche LTZ with 169k miles on it.  I bought the truck with 157k miles for 11k, and have put 4k into it in the last 3 year (most of which was the hydraulic fix I knew about when i bought it.)  I drive it 4,000 miles a year, 10 miles to work each day and occasional dump runs.  The van is the kid hauler and wife plans on keeping it indefinitely until this kids are grown (10 +/- more years)..

I bought the truck for two reasons.  1) I mistakenly thought we'd buy a towable camping thing - which we've since decided against.  2) it's nice having a truck around when you need it..It's running great and no expected major fixes.

I think the KBB Value trade in on the truck is $7500.  I've been debating if I should ride the truck out for another 2-5 years and squeak out every ounce of value out of it, or use the value toward another vehicle.  Side question - if a major repair came up, such as an engine or transmission - would I be best off making the repair or scrapping it...?

If I were to use the current value toward another vehicle - i've debated a couple things.  I have 3 kids, 3 booster seats.  The kids don't ride in my car much, but it does happen - so I don't want it to be miserable.  Should i try to find a 30-45mpg vehicle to optimize my gas consumption, or who cares with my annual mileage being so low?  It'd save about 400-500 a year in gas I think.  

Typing this out, I'm expecting the answer to be ""keep the truck and drive it into the ground as long as you can tolerate it"".  Right?

Financially speaking - my goal is balancing average monthly cost of ownership and comfort in driving.  It's not a question of 'can I afford this or that', it's more focused on what makes sense.  I could get a 2007 honda civic, but then the kids never want to squeeze in it.  I could get a 2021 Highlander Hybrid, but then i'm tying up 45k in a vehicle driving 4,000 miles a year...

53,personalfinance,Advice on debt with a windfall,"Next month I am expecting a windfall in the form of an unusually large bonus. I have two sources of debt, about 9k in federal student loans at 4-5% interest (currently frozen because of CARES) and a 11k car loan at 2.5% interest (I bought a year ago) I would like to pay one of them off, but I'm going back and forth on which. The student loans have a lower monthly payment, but I've been lucky enough lately that neither of the payments are difficult to make at this point.

I'd like to focus on debt because I already have a 6 month emergency fund, 10% + 4% match going into my 401k, and 20% for a house down payment sitting in my savings for one day (tried to buy in the spring but was unable to without a fully cash offer in this market).

55,personalfinance,"New career, emergency fund, self-employed 401k vs. credit card debt ($6k)","Hi all, 

After a few years of ups and downs career wise, getting a new job right before I went to school internationally, going to school internationally and graduating during the pandemic, I finally have stability. I am just paying down today $3k of consumer credit card debt, out of 9k. This leaves me with 6k left. I also want to build an emergency fund and, having just returned from Europe, I need to rent while I look for a home (with potential to rent it, as I travel back and forth between Europe for extended periods of time. And no, my life isn't that bougee). I just went from $35,000 to a really good salary at a stable company with good benefits. I can't see myself needing a $14,000 emergency fund right away. The other problem is that I'd like to put some income into the 401k before the end of the year. I can't contribute to my W-2 employer 401, but I can contribute as both employer and employee to my LLC's, which I just created. Should I get rid of the debt first, then put what's left into the 401? This is confusing! 

As to why the consumer debt went so high: I suppose taking care of a family of 6 siblings + parents during a divorce where parent has mental illness, while living on my own really caught up to me years ago in 2018. I also left a toxic job, spent $4k on starting a new business that tanked initially. I've set boundaries with my family since, including them getting me into collections for things like utilities, which stupidly were in my name; not paying me back for $2000 vet bills, etc.

I thought I was leaving for london in 2018 so I didnt show up to an interview for a job, and then my visa didnt come and I had to wait 10 months. So I was really sunk financially for a while. I finally started working in December 2018 and then got a good job in June 2019 (delayed 6 months due to budget at a large company). It's been a crazy few years, hoping things are better here on out. I'm not a complete moron, I just think everything kind of hit the fan at once and I was left with a massive pile of debt.

This was on the 4th of September, and the card was supposed to be delivered in 7-10 business days, as I ordered the card on a Saturday I expected it to be sent out on Monday, and I made a call by Friday the 10th checking that it was sent and the address was correct, because I had started to get some unusual anxiety about it. They assured me it was, that it should be arriving soon, and it was to the correct address. Another week passed and on September the 16th I contacted them on the help chat through their app, and was assured it would arrive on the 20th.

I was told I would have to pay a $15 charge for expedited service and that was the only option available. So I reluctantly agreed. Now is this a scam?

61,personalfinance,Retirement plan through insurance company. Is this a good offer?,"Hi. Im 25, dont live in the US, and have no idea how to invest for my retirement. I live in Bosnia. We dont have pre-tax IRAs here, we have a pension fund (that I cant control how much I contribute to or receive from). I have no idea how to find a financial advisor here (they all seem to be for companies). I need help deciding if the offer I got from an insurance company is good.

The offer:
1400 EUR/year installment
35 years (until I’m 60)
59,000 EUR insured sum (how much I’d’ve paid and the minimum I’d get back)
69,000 EUR insured sum + gains

The fine print says the “gain” is calculated based on forecasted interest rates for the following years. Its not guaranteed. 

I can even do an option where it does not get paid out lump sum in 35 years, rather monthly (like a paycheck or pension) for the next e.g. 15 years and the principal still continues to grow, meaning that all in all, I would receive around 91,000 EUR (my insured sum + forecasted gains). 50 years adds up. Also if I croak, my husband can inherit whatever I’d contributed thus far + any gains on that. And I can change the installment at the end of each year if I want. 

Is this a good idea? I don’t really have any better options. This would only be like 10% of my income, so its not a big deal. I can use more of my “savings money” to invest in real estate or something else to *diversify*.

More info: Husband and I will pay off our car and mortgage within the next 3 years. No other debt. We have an emergency fund, and I have vested stocks in my company.

3. Since most of my funds are locked in retirement accounts, I believe I need to do the Mega backdoor Roth. Is that something I can take on myself? Or should I find a professional?

68,personalfinance,Need advice: Borrowed $ from my mom - how to tell the bank when I refinance our house?,"When we originally bought my house a couple of years ago we borrowed cash from my mom and her boyfriend instead of getting a mortgage with a bank, because the property was in ""unliveable"" condition. We wrote an official mortgage note for her boyfriend, but not for my mom. Now, we want to refinance and pay them back and get a regular mortgage with a bank. I told the bank about the mortgage with my mom's bf but not my mom.

What should I do - tell the bank that the payments to my mom were us supporting her economically or something? Or come clean and tell them we owe her money but it's not with an official mortgage note? She doesn't technically have a lien on our property in the same way my mom's bf has, so maybe the bank won't care? 

NB: I came clean about this to other banks/mortgage brokers while I was shopping around and they didn't seem to think my mom's mortgage would count as a real mortgage so I shouldn't worry about it. I have not however told the bank I would like to use, as they have the lowest rates.",1632236786

I'm guessing ""What should I invest in"" questions are probably quite common but the only advice I ever get from people is 'stick it in a fund/stocks'. Which is fine, I'm happy to get a 5-10% annual return, but 10% of 'not very much' is still 'not very much'. I want to really increase my worth.

I have an 'emergency' fund already, I have no debt whatsoever, I pay enough into my work pension that my employer matches up to the highest amount they'll pay, assume I am already saving enough for retirement in a tax efficient account.

Yes I could get a good incremental return over time and build up my savings so that in 15-20 years I'll have a good sum, but what can I do with my money to grow it a bit faster? I'm ok with taking some risk.

* I have a full time job already so anything time intensive (e.g. day trading) is out
* Crypto is too prone to being hacked; I'm happy to accept market risk, less happy to accept the possibility of straight up *theft*.
* I don't have 'buy a property' money, yet
* I'm not creative so I can't start my own business making and selling stuff
* I have no talent so I can't start my own business selling my talents
* Peer to Peer lending rates don't seem to be better than equities/funds
* Everything is priced in already, without insider knowledge I don't see how options trading is anything more than guesswork.

76,personalfinance,"Starting WFH research job in UK, paid by stipend by a German organisation, not ""employed"" or ""under contract""","Hi there

First time poster. 

I'm about to start an 18month Post-doctoral position on an academic research project. The project  is based at a university in Germany, and funded entirely by a grant from a private German philanthropic organisation.

Under the terms of the grant, I will be paid by monthly stipend, and I am not  ""employed"" by either the organistion or university through a contract. 

The stipend is not considered taxable income in Germany and were I to have moved to Germany to take up the position, this issue would not have arisen.  Due to Covid and the fact that I can carry out my duties without needing to move, I'm remaining in the UK and the stipend will be paid to my UK bank account.

I've enquired with HMRC about this, and all they've given me is that ""If you are engaged under an employment contract you will be liable to UK tax on the income""

This is after explaning tht I am not engaged under an employment contract, but being paid a stipend by a philanthropic organisation as part of a research grant.

The total annual amount of the stipend comes to around £21k (although i don't know what this will be with the exchange rate fluctuations), which would make me liable for around £1700 income tax and £1400 NI annually.  

Does anyone have any experience of this situation or anything like it? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can see how I would need to be classed as self employed and the stipend as taxable income, but a number of things make it seem perverse that it be treated as if it were income from an employed, contracted role, given that there is no contract of employment, or benefits, and also given that this type of payment is not considered taxable income in Germany.

I don't see why this income should be taxed in the UK at the marginal rate given that it's being converted in the first instance, so its not clear what amount they're referring to when setting out a taxation reference (net, gross, exchange rate at the start of the work period, or an average across it?). 

Finally, how would national insurance work under these circumstances? Assuming HMRC maintain it is taxable income and I can't fight this, I assume I'll be taxed as self employed. If so, how am I able to provide invoices and reciepts for the work done, in order to fill out an end of year tax return? Also, given I will be liable for NI contributions at the same rate, again, how am I expected to ""bill"" the foundation as a self employed contractor?

It can't see how this money is taxable as income from a contracted employment role, given the relationship I have to the foundation is not of this nature, and I also don't see how I could be classed as self-employed, and this as billable income to which I can issue an invoice to the foundation for services rendered.  Given the amount is subject to neither of these in the country of origin and I'm not contracturally ""employed"" as such under any recognised meaning of that term, I'm at a bit of a loss to know what to do.",1632235712

So let's say I have a loan that is $10,000 at 3.7380% interest (3.8027% APR), and the repayment schedule is $100 per month for 120 months. I make my first payment at the end of the first month and the math works out to be that my principal balance drops to $9,931.15. Let's assume I also decide to throw a $1,000 prepayment at the loan on the same day I make the first payment. Are the prepayment terms effectively saying that my principal balance would now be $8,931.15, thus reducing the interest that accrues on the loan each month, and also shortening my repayment term (by my math the loan would be paid in 106 months instead of 120)?",1632233914

87,personalfinance,"Traditional, Roth, or Both?","Last week I (30m) received a small raise and figured I would start contributing more to my retirement. I do my best to plan for the future, but this particular issue was difficult for me considering all of the unknowns involved.


When I went to go increase my current contribution I was given the option to choose how much of my salary I'd like to contribute to Traditional or Roth plan. I spent some time researching these two options and almost everything I read came down to, ""would you like to get taxed now, or later?"" This feels like a loaded question and here are my thoughts:

Say I plan on retiring at 65 years old. Knowing both myself and my wife, I doubt we will want or need a larger home for retirement than we do now when our family is growing. We are planning to purchase our first home in the next few years (hopefully) which, as long as the world can keep it together that long, would mean we would own our home by the time we retire. Or, if we don't own the home, at least we could drastically lower our mortgage payments by downsizing, refinancing, etc. A lot of unknowns, I know. All this being said, I have a hard time believing that I will be needing a salary greater than what I make now when I retire, which would indicate being taxed later (traditional) may be a better option because we may be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than we are now. 

However, I also think about the concept of inflation. Living off of, let's say 100k a year now, may be equivalent to living off of 120-130k 30 years from now, which means what I make now may be what I need in retirement. I may be overthinking this or flat out thinking of this incorrectly so please correct me if that is so. 

Some current financial background:
Current salary: 90k
Wife's approx. Salary: 35k (will be moving part time soon due to baby)
Emergency Fund: 20k
Current contribution: 3% Traditional (really bad, I know...)
Desired contribution: 6% (for now, until after baby comes and can see my finances then)

88,personalfinance,The Ideal Safety Features:Price Ratio of Car Buying,"I apologize in advance for the title of this post. I really struggled with how to summarize my question. 

**TL;DR: My wife is pregnant and when the baby is born we will have 4 children 5 &amp; under. This is the last kid.  lol   At what point does a new enough/expensive enough car meet sufficient safety standards for a family with 4 very young kids? I want to keep my family safe but not break the bank. Are the safety features on a used 2010 Toyota Sienna good enough? What about a new 2022 Honda Pilot? A used 2018 Chrysler Pacifica? Does a used $15,000 car get me just as safe a car as a new $30,000 car?**


So here are some details to explain my exact situation. 

**Car Situation**

We currently have a 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE Limited with 175,000 miles on it that we bought years ago when I was still in grad school for $5,000. I think the time to upgrade is shortly arriving and I would like to get a new car sometime between Sep 2022 and March 2023, giving me roughly 12-18 months to figure out a plan and hopefully let the market cool down a bit with the chip issues. 

I generally prefer to buy used as I don't like eating depreciation costs, however, this is the first time I'm buying a car with a big boy salary ($95,000). In my mind, I should be looking at a ~2012-2015 3rd row car and whether that's a minivan or a midsize to large SUV it doesn't matter. I can find those in the $10,000-$18,000 range depending on miles and trim and all that good stuff. However, I'm probably too stingy with my money and need some perspective and help to find where to draw the line on safety and price and some level of luxury/convenience. 


**Financial details**

I currently have $6000 set apart for a down payment and I am adding about $100/month to it until we end up buying one. This gives me 20% down a ~$30,000 car. With a credit score of 780, I can get a plenty good rate.  My wife is a SAHM and we only have my income. My income is about as steady and secure as you can get. I am a federal employee many years past my probation period with years of highly-rated annual reviews with important responsibilities. 

If I follow the classic advice of 20% down, 4 years, no more than 10% of monthly gross then that means I could very reasonably buy a ~$42,000 car and have my payments in the ~$750-$800 range which is about 10% of my gross. This seems like an absurd amount to spend on a car, though, unless I'm just a tightwad who doesn't value the newest and best in safety for his kids? Even if you toss in insurance and gas costs into the 10% it would still probably be close to a $40,000 car. 

Does a 2021 or newer ~$40,000 car which costs about 10% of my monthly gross provide significantly better safety and value for my young family than an older used ~2014 car which would only be about 4% of my monthly gross? 

**Help me find the balance between being too much of a financial tightwad and taking care of my family within my means**

Now generally I would just do the daily income and daily expenditures that I make/spend and then add it up at the end of the month.

However this doesn't really tell me how much I am making from the lessons. (Obviously this is a simple example, and it can get more complex). 

Like, at the end of 20 lessons I would have marked that I have made $20 x 20 lessons is $400 but actually I spent $15 dollars so my true income from that would be $385. When I take into consideration other lessons, and other expenditures such as the cost of the rented room etc.

98,personalfinance,Should I be irked by this bill from our pediatrician?,"On my daughter's check-up, her weight had dipped a bit and it concerned our pediatrician. We told her that the dip was  exaggerated as the weight prior to the dip was taken with her fully clothed and in a diaper (she was sick and was weighed differently than her normal weigh-ins are). The second weight check was after she was sick for a week and didn't eat well, as well as being entirely unclothed/no diaper. The whole thing caused the fluctuation in weight to be exaggerated. 

Our pediatrician said she understood but just to bring our daughter to our other daughter's visit in two weeks just so they could check her weight. So, two weeks later we have our other daughter's check-up, bring both of our daughters and they quickly weigh our first daughter, see her weight is back up, and that's that.

Today we get a bill for $95, $45 of which we owe as a copay. They billed my daughter's weigh-in as an office visit that falls outside of her standard checkups. 

Here is why I feel irked. I'm a 4th year medical student. My wife is a nurse practitioner. Neither of us were concerned about the weight, we explained the abnormal weight to our doctor, and we both have the capacity to weigh her at home and bring her in if we see something abnormal. I didn't need a $100 weight check, particularly when I currently live off of student loans. And not only that, it was sold to us as a ""hey, just bring your daughter along for her sister's check-up and we'll weigh her"" sort of thing, not that it would be her own visit.

I've worked with a lot of doctors on my rotations who do not bill out visits to people when the visit winds up being very simple, or for other extraneous reasons. I will be a physician in 8 months and I can genuinely say I would not bill someone who came by to hop on the scale. Hell, on my family med rotation, it was a near-daily occurrence to have people come back and recheck things like weight or BP if we were concerned, and it was never used as an attempt at extra billing. I already paid this bill, but it has left a sour taste in my mouth. Would you be okay with this? Do you think it's justified?",1632230340

We have about $45k in Fed student loans we are continuing to pay down, and $8k on a car loan at ~4.5%. Credit is excellent. We are SWIMMING in refi offers, so I'm trying to choose what makes sense.

**My hope would be to refi at a lower rate, drop the PMI, and cash out $10k to knock out the auto loan and help us drop the largest student loan balance as well.** Emergency fund, retirement, and student loan payments are all fully funded.

I know the market is overinflated, but our county-appraised value (historically very low) is $220k for our home. Therefore, I was thinking leveraging $10k in equity to pay off the car and shift the $400-500/month to student loan payments (saved from PMI &amp; car payment) would be a big help, with minimal risk, even if the market declines.

19,personalfinance,HELP w/ planning,"I (32F) recently broke up with my spouse of 5.5 years, and I need help planning for my future and setting up a financial plan/goal. I make \~$90,000-99,000 a year (working 40 hours a week). I am looking into working atleast 15 more hours a week for $77-79 an hour (more pay on the WE) to increase my chance of achieving my financial goal, as needed. I have a 401k account, and maximize my employer's 6% dollar for dollar max contribution. I also invest and maximize the 6,000 per year Roth IRA limit. In total, both accounts have a combined retirement fund of $62,000. I know it's a little low in terms of the expert's guidelines set but I went to grad school that pushed me back w/ my financial goals even more. I have $20,000 in student loan debt. I have no other responsibilities. I do not have any children. I make $500 in car payments a month, and I have 2 more years to pay it off. Afterwards, I am keeping this car until it dies on me. Since I just recently moved out, I have been staying at my mum's which will significantly lower my monthly housing cost by a good chunk from $1700 to $300 a month (my mum's rate as her mortgage is literally $500 a month for a $300,000 home. I do not like my mum's neighborhood as it's in the pseudo-burbs (in between the city and suburbs)-no offense. Ideally, I would like to purchase a home in my old neighborhood as it is a 15 mins bike ride to work and it is in the middle of everything. The problem is the cheapest semi-updated home runs around $450,000. And these are not big homes and usually runs between 1100-1500 sq ft, I guess I just hope that the housing market slows down by then but I can't put too much on hope.  I also live in TX which has a crazy property tax rate of 2-2.3%. For all of you number crunchers out there, do you think I can afford that kind of a home in 3-5 years, while still not neglecting my retirement goals? Given the detail I outlined above, do you think it is possible? I do not foresee my salary going up in terms of hourly rate in the next 5 years but I can always pick up more work as needed.",1632224098
20,personalfinance,Should I Cash Out My Brokerage Account and Pay Off My Student Loans?,"Back in April, I was frustrated that I had money sitting in my savings account and I had already fully funded my IRA. I had never really considered opening up a taxable brokerage account, but suddenly it sounded like a great idea. All told, it has about 13K in it now, and all of that money is currently invested. 

I have student loans but it's not nearly as bad as a lot of people. At the time I opened the brokerage account, I think I had caught a bit of FOMO, which is why I wanted to throw more money into the market, as opposed to paying down the debt. But more recently, since about mid-July, I decided I should really start aggressively paying down the student loan (I think the realization that payments and interest were starting up again soon kicked me in the rear), and I have got it down to about 13K owed. 

Considering the volatility that everybody seems to be egging on, does it make financial sense to cash out my brokerage account and use that money to essentially eliminate my student loan? I'm not too worried about capital gains. I'll have to pay some, sure, but 1. if I liquidated all of my positions right now, I would be able to capture some decent losses, too, so it would soften the blow, and 2. i will have a bit more cash in my pocket if I don't have to make any more payments on that loan, and I could set some aside for tax time. 

I'm sure this won't get a ton of attention, which is fine, but even if someone directed me towards a resource that would help me think through this, I would appreciate it.",1632223620

29,personalfinance,Misleading Independent Builder: Builder not providing warranty information after closing,"I closed on my first home 8/2/21 near downtown Atlanta, Georgia.

The builder/selling agent is a wife and husband operation. Small independent builders using hard money lending. Anyhow, they built a nice house, especially for the current market but showed me a nightmare to finish the last 5% of it as I went into contract when it was about 95% complete. 

Now, I am about 50~ days post-closing. There are still some outstanding minor items that the builder had to finish but was not on the contract so at this point I'm biting the bullet on it and taking a loss. I'll have to do it myself. The biggest issue I am having is that I have a 2/10 warranty that the builder is supposed to provide but is not on the contract (contract has 1/8 warranty on it signed by both parties). My agent (useless but only realized after going to far to change the agent) took it off of his commission and had the builder agree to 2/10 upgrade from 1/8 but NEVER GOT IT ON THE CONTRACT. He just assured me it would be provided on the day of closing and that he paid for it. In my agents defense, the builder provided the receipt to paying the warranty company (RWC) for 2/10 to the closing attorney. The seller agent (the wife) also sent me the coverage document for the warranty the morning of closing. The attorney also confirmed that he had the receipt and that I don't need to worry about it. Anyway, 50 post-closing, it felt like it had been a little long for me to not receive any information on my warranty and I have some issues to get fixed so I called the warranty company (the builder is no longer responsive). The warranty company now notifies me that the warranty has been paid for and that they have all of my information but they have not received the ""application of warranty"" signed by me and the builder so my warranty is not active. I still can't get into to contact with the builder and it seems like the seller agent has my number blocked. My agent got his commission and is also irresponsive.

One question I had was if RWC has the payment and my information. How do they not have an application? Why do I have to sign for a warranty being provided to me? 

Also, what recourse do I have against the seller to provide this document? I just need him to sign it, then I can sign it so he can send it over. Apparently, RWC tells me, only the member (the builder) can send in the document. 

This all just seems so fishy to me. All I know is at worst, even if not a 2/10, the builder is contractually obligated to provide a 1/8 warranty but simply has not provided it yet. Is legal action my only recourse? If so, how much is a 2/10 builder warranty supposed to cost for a 605k house? Could I just do small claims and avoid lawyer fees? Is a lawyer necessary/recommended for something as obvious as this? I am at a loss for what to do at this point and would really appreciate some direction. Cheers!",1632215225

33,personalfinance,Bluebird by American Express - Account Permanently Suspended,"Hello!

I seen a lot of posts like this on reddit but they were from a few years ago and I wanted to see if this happened to anyone recently. I've had bluebird since 2016 and had no issues with them until this past year, I opened an account because I couldn't get a bank account and the reason I never switched was because my direct deposit went into that bluebird account. Every week, I would go to the atm, take out my paycheck and put it in my regular bank. 

I recently lost my debit card to my bank and because of that, as an alternate, I added funds from my original checking account to my bluebird account  and while I trying to add funds and I kept getting an error message then it said my account was locked and then when I tried calling the number on the back of my card, it said my account was permanently suspended and to look at my email for further information. In the email, it gave no reason why my account was suddenly suspended and told me to write a letter. I now have no access to my bluebird card or the money on the account, I can't even log in and every time I try calling the number on the back of my card, I get the message that my account was suspended and they hang up on me, I can't even talk to a representative. 

My paycheck gets deposited on that account and the majority of my money is on my bluebird card. I want to cry as I don't know how I can access my funds or try to pay my bills this week.  I have no idea what to do or how I can get this fixed.

I was wondering if anyone on here went through this with bluebird, if you were able to get access to your funds and what did you do to get this problem solved or if anyone had any advice on how I should proceed?

38,personalfinance,Have enough to pay off Student Loans: Invest or Payoff?," Been chewing on this question for a while and decided its time to ask the wisdom of [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/). Made an account just for this...long time lurker though, love the subreddit.

Some background expenses:

* Annual Income: 70k pre-tax
* Rent:   $250 (I live with my parents and their house has long since been paid   off. I just chip-in for groceries, utilities and phone bill. My parents   are a bit older so I also do errands/housework to make up for the no   rent thing.)
* Car:   $305/month with 36 months left on the loan. I don't pay insurance yet   (I loaned my parents a not so insignificant amount of money some years   back right after college and so in return they offered to pay for the   insurance policy that we all are on...also explains the rent thing I   guess)
* Retirement Fund: I max out my employer's match on my 401K.

I   realize I am in a very, very fortunate situation at the moment. I am   beyond lucky that my parents are so gracious and also happen to live in   the same city my job is in at the moment. This has resulted in me being   able to in the last few years aggressively save and invest. Which  leads  me with a rather fortunate problem...

So here's the situation:

* Student Loan Balance: $14,000 at average 4% interest across 5 loans. No private loans, only federal.
* Monthly payments before Covid: $205
* Money in reserve (including liquid investments + emergency fund): $70,000.

So   here's my question. With the whole Covid forbearance thing, I was able  to stop all payments on my loan and completely divert them to  investment  accounts/extra 401k/pad my emergency fund. But with  forbearance ending soon, the question remains:

1. Should I just pay off my loans completely while the interest rate is still 0%?
2. Should   I ""put aside"" the balance of my loans from my reserves into a safe   index fund that will outpace interest + monthly minimums in growth?

Reading   through the subreddit makes me think 1 is the logical choice. Flipside   is the immediate sting of being out $14,000 that I could be investing,  as in situation 2?

What should I  do here? Am I being overly risky by not paying it off? I  realize I'm in  a pretty lucky position right now with low rent/expenses  and large  warchest so I want to maximize my luck before I either  inevitably move  out or I accidentally blow up one of my accounts doing  something really  dumb after getting overconfident in the markets on a  random Tuesday.",1632208430
39,personalfinance,Any good tools for keeping track of deferred purchases?,"One of my current objectives is to get a bit smarter about managing money. 

If there's one area that I could definitely use improvement on it's online shopping.

I'm typically pretty good at living within my means. I eat out at most once a week. Don't take many vacations. But when it comes to anything I see online that's reasonably cheap ... I tend to just order it so that I won't forget about it. 

The obvious problem: lots of small orders can easily add up to one big chunk of cash. 

What I order? A lot of tech stuff. To provide a couple of examples, here are some current things on my ""tech wish list"" that I've thus far managed to refrain from buying because I know that I don't really *need* them, however much I *want* them:

\- An additional UPS to put my home networking gear on

\- A networking cabinet to put my routers in

Both are things I can definitely live without. 

The obvious solution is to create wish lists. My objection to them is that stuff tends to go out of stock. So if I take the time to pick out (say) a networking cabinet and bookmark that URL, there's a good chance that by the time I actually determine that it's a reasonable purchase (perhaps in a year when we have more space) the catalog will have been totally updated. 

What do you guys use? I guess something for triaging desired products would be good as well as something that lets you manage things you want from various stores in one place.

Since I got a late start, my portfolio is pretty aggressive, but I still feel like a newbie at this and I'm sure I could be doing some things better.

I have no debt and I've been working on selling my extra stuff on eBay, so I've got a little stream of extra money that I don't need to spend on anything. 

I have a Roth IRA (Fidelity), a post-tax Individual market account (Fidelity), a HYSA (Ally), and an Acorns account.

The Roth IRA is maxed for the year, and the HYSA is at what I believe to be a healthy emergency fund number ($15K).

I know Acorns isn't the best investment platform, but I've liked the simplicity of it and have been able to grow it pretty decently.

I opened the Individual market account earlier this year thinking that I'd start throwing extra money into that. But the $500 I started with in February is only $513 today and I'm feeling very uncertain about picking the index funds to put anymore money into.

Obviously, the market is pretty stagnant right now and that's going to be reflected in any investment platform. My instinct is to just keep adding extra money into the Acorns account, but I'd like to hear potential smarter ideas for the Individual fund. Or maybe I should add an extra buffer to the HYSA—how much is really enough?

52,personalfinance,Do gifts of $30k from a married couple have to be written on two checks to avoid it counting against the estate?,"Do gifts of $30k from a married couple have to be written on two checks ($15k each, one from each spouse) to avoid it counting against the estate?   


And if  a single check is okay, does it have to come from a joint account? Or can it come from one of the spouse's personal accounts?  


Before too many people chime in to say that there's no way the estate is going to be worth over $11.7 million, this is in NY State, where there's a state estate tax ""cliff"" at $5.9 million. If you are under this cliff amount, you pay ***no*** NY state estate taxes. If you actually hit this amount, then you rapidly start paying large amounts of estate tax. E.g., if the estate is worth $6.2 million, then the estate taxes will be $518k.  


My mother is currently a bit over the cliff amount. Consequently, she is looking to give me $30k per year from now on so that she'll be under the cliff amount upon her wordly departure. She's planning on writing me one check from her personal trading account, not a joint account, but I'm worried that this won't pass the scrutiny of the NY estate tax auditors, should they notice this. I'm worried that either two checks, or a joint account are required.  


P.S. I know that this has probably been answered here before, but I've tried to search for such an answer using many different search terms, and haven't found the answer to this question. I apologize, and thank you in advance for your kind assistance.  


P.P.S. I know that it's even a bit more complicated because in New York all gifts made within three years of death count towards the estate. But let's ignore that for now.

P.P.S. Another strategy is for her to give me like $2 million right now, and hope she lives another three years. As long as three years have passed, then the gift will not count towards the estate as far as NY is concerned. Were she to die earlier than 3 years from giving me the $2 million, then that entire $2 million ***would*** count towards the estate. Let's ignore this for now.

53,personalfinance,"I own a condo and want to leverage it to pay off debt and move to a new property, but not sure how","Aloha all, I own a condo in Hawai'i in a popular area. I've lived in it for the last 4+ years. My long term dreams are to purchase land to build a home. I am recently self employed.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have a fair amount of debt on credit cards from poor decisions in my past, about $35k floating around on several cards. My interest rates are terrible, I've never been in the best position to pay them down. Because of my high debt to credit ratio, my credit score is low, in the low 600s. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have remodeled my condo and the market value has increased dramatically. I currently owe about 250k on it and units around me are selling for 4-500K.

&amp;#x200B;

I could sell the condo and make a good chunk of change, pay off my debts and still have a good amount left over. Downfall to this is I no longer own property in a market that does not look like it's going down anytime soon (I feel it would take a massive economic problem to cause Hawai'i to decrease in value).

&amp;#x200B;

What would be my best route moving forward if ultimately owning land is my goal? 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is not good because of my debt, so getting a loan is not as easy right now. I have family that is looking to cosign, as well, as an investment.

54,personalfinance,Selling new car for a used one,"My husband and I bought a brand new car in May of this year. We’ve been looking to buy a new home in our area, but there’s nothing we can find that fits our criteria. We met with a bank who told us that the only way we could support two mortgages and be able to build would be to eliminate $500 from our monthly debts. All we have now is our current mortgage, student loan payments, a credit card payment (152 a month) for a new air unit we had to install last year on our home, and our dumb car payment (615 a month—I know a dumb decision). 

I’ve been thinking about our situation and the only thing I can think of would be to sell our new car for a used one (lower car payment) and then throw the extra cash at the credit card payment for the air unit to equal the 500 a month so we can begin the process to build a new home. 

What do y’all think? Is this a good decision or am I screwed/missing something?",1632200353

56,personalfinance,Question about mortgages and FHA loans,"Recently, my father in law passed. Him and his wife have a mortgage through Wells Fargo. Going through paperwork, I learned he went through HUD to provide a smaller down payment (I believe it’s an FHA loan, but I’m not 100% on terminology.) 

Fast forward to today, my mother in law receives a letter stating her mortgage servicer is being transferred to another company. This letter came from Novad Consulting, and is dated September 22, 2021, and is to be transferred on October 8, 2021. 

She was discussing it with my wife, and we were all confused, as WF is the servicer of the mortgage. And the loan number in the letter is different than the WF number. So we called WF, and they confirmed they are the servicer of the mortgage, and that HUD is listed as a lien holder, and that loan number matched what the Novad letter has. 

My question is this (due to my not understanding how this works): How/when are the HUD loans paid? They’ve been paying on the house nearly 20 years, and I’ve never seen any paperwork or payment to HUD or Novad. Neither has my wife or mother in law. How can we go about verifying with HUD the legitimacy of this letter?",1632199191

Both at 2.875% but lender A provided $1500 credit to cover all closing costs and two weeks closing time. Lender B provided $4100 closing costs which after covering all closing costs it would have $1500 cash to us at closing, and 50 days closing time. 

Now this is where I get confused. Lender A is saying that the maximum amount of credit a lender can provide equals to the cost of the loan, lender legally cannot provide credit exceeding the cost, and lender credit cannot apply to prepaid interests. So we wouldn’t be able to get the 1.5k from lender B at closing anyways. And 50 days closing from lender b is weird given our refi appraisal is waived.

With a repayment period of 10 years, I would be looking at a 800-900 monthly student loan payment (most of my loans are federally subsized/have moderately low interest-rates).

Moreover, I was unsure how frugal I should be with how much I should spend on rent. Coming from the Great Plains, spending 1.5k a month on a 'nice' apartment sounds absurd and like a pure waste. Yet, I'm also very keen on having a nice environment to decompress/work hybrid when needed (also having amenities is important). Not to mention, this area of the country is entirely unfamiliar to me and I know absolutely no one there, hence a 'hip' area with a good social scene would also be a plus.

I typically spend about $100-$120 a pay check for me and my mom for groceries/household needs. I eat out on Sundays, about $40 for the whole day.

Is it a good idea to take the money I have in the 401k with my job and the Roth IRA out and use the money to pay off some more debt? I have $2700 in my 401k, and 1k in my Roth IRA. I understand it's taxable, but I'm assuming I pay taxes when I file them, correct me if I'm wrong. I get paid soon, so if I withdrew from both the Roth and the 401k, I could pay off the IKEA and any 1 of the other 3 credit cards, leaving me even more to pay towards the last two each pay check. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! It's up to me to get me and my mom out of the abusive house we are in now, and I'm trying my best to get us out.

Leaving myself $150, I can give $55 to each card a month. If I did $55, it would just accumulate back up due to interest. I feel stuck, like I'm in a rut.

I am getting married next month and we want to buy a house when the time is right. I am 25 years old and my soon-to-be wife is 27.

- Finances:

Location: NYC (Want to move to CT)

Combined income: $170,000

Debt: $60,000 in student loans

Savings: $39,000

Rent payment: $1,400

We are thinking of budgeting to pay the student loans ASAP and then save for a 20% down payment + our emergency fund. We are just having a hard time knowing where to start and how to manage the house savings.

Do we have too much on savings? Should we put that towards the student loans?

98,personalfinance,"Looking for feedback on my current finances, and advice on how to plan for future goals","Hello r/personalfinance, long time reader here, first time poster on a throwaway. 

I'm 26 years old, with my bachelors in information security. Moved across the country earlier this year after graduating to take a job in the DC area for a non-profit. No student debt, I'm very fortunate in that my parents set up a 529 account for me when I was young and went to an in-state college. My main goals are to be financially independent enough to retire early (hopefully in ~20 years). I've been pretty zealous about saving up, but I think that it's not in places that I could access if/when I retire.

## Monthly Budget
| Name | Amount | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Trad 403(b) Contribution | $1,950 | Plan to have this at the max in Month 10 of each year, then the remaining two months will add to my normal paycheck for a nice ""bonus""|
| Trad 457(b) Contribution | $1,950 | See above |
| Takehome(after taxes, etc) | $2,711 | |
| Rent/Utils/Internet | $1,300 | Split with my partner 75/25 based off of the sum of our combined salaries |
| Groceries | $300 | Split monthly groceries with my partner 50/50 |
| Eating Out | $325 | I know it's a lot, but my partner and I both really like supporting local businesses and it's a fun date option for us |
| Spotify	| $9.99 | |
| Gas	| $30 | |
| Renter's Insurance | $15 | |
| Car Insurance	| $40 | |
| Phone Bill |	$25 | |
| Remainder ""fun money"" | $666 | I somehow end up with a little less than this every month, but I'm still operating at a surplus somehow |

## Assets/Misc
| Asset | Amount | Other |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Credit Card | $10,000 limit| Have had this card for a while, don't carry a balance, but it's my only line of credit |
| Roth IRA | $38,000 | In Vanguard's 2060 target retirement |
| 401(k) | $19,000 | Leftover from my first job, still in their system but I'm being charged now to keep it with them |
| 403(b) | $1,950 | In the Vanguard 2060 target retirement |
| 457(b) | $1,950 | In the Vanguard 2060 target retirement |
| Bank 1 Checking Account | $9,000 |  |
| Bank 1 Saving Account | $25,000 | Started this as an emergency account, but I think it's too well funded, and the money's not earning nearly enough interest where it is |
| Bank 2 Checking Account | $2,500 | Started this because it does better with fees than Bank 1, thinking I'm going to shift more to this in the future |
| Pension | 2% x Number of years Served x 24 months of highest salary | In order to get this pension, I have to work in the University system for a minimum of 10 years, and they take 6% out of my paycheck |
| 529 | $27,000 |  |
| Credit Score | 760-770 |  |

Notes: Just started contributing to my 403b and 457b, and will put $1,950 per month into them in order to max them out by year's end. Have already maxed my IRA this year, and will budget that into my monthly plan for next year, but I like ""dumping"" the money in at the start of the year and then not having to worry about it again.

## Goals
- Get masters degree in Information Security (paid for by my new employer)
- Retire at age 45
- Move abroad after retirement (Singapore or Taiwan)

## Issues
- I only have the one line of credit (offered through Bank 1)
- Not investing my cash right now outside of retirement accounts
- Healthcare plan as of right now is using a PPO, I'm going to try and shift to a HDHP so I can contribute to the HSA

## Next Steps
- Apply for more lines of credit
- Switch to a HDHP health plan and open an HSA when open enrolment comes around in about 3 months
- Roll over my old 401(k) to the 403(b)
- Move money out of my savings until I only have 6 months of expenses there, then invest the rest into S&amp;P 500 I guess? For retirement in the next 20 years.

Does all of this seem in order? Is there anything I'm not thinking about besides this? Let me know if there's anything else I'm missing here, looking forward to your feedback!",1632187635
1,personalfinance,Should I help my aging dad refinance his mortgage by co-signing?,"Hi everyone! My (23F) dad (66M) is asking me to help him refinance his mortgage. 

I am currently working while attending college full-time. My dad works full-time (Monday-Saturday, sometimes Sundays too) as a remodeling/residential contractor. He is low-income. My (17F) sister lives with him. Our mom is not in the picture at all. 

My dad currently has an ARM mortgage at 6.75% interest. He signed up for it back in 2004 and has about 16 years left on the loan. 

I helped him look at a couple different banks to compare rates to refinance his house. When we found a bank with the best deal for him (3.5% interest), the loan officer told us that unfortunately they cannot qualify him because his income is too low and his debt to income ratio is too high. The only way we could get it is if he increases his income and tries again after a year or two or if he gets someone to co-sign on the mortgage loan with him. With my income, he would qualify for the refinance.

Hearing this news was extremely discouraging. My dad is in a rough financial situation and is essentially living paycheck to paycheck. 

It's my understanding that I would be responsible for the mortgage payments should anything happen even though I have moved out (I live with my boyfriend and our roommate). I highly doubt that my dad would intentionally not pay the mortgage in hopes of me covering for it, he is a good-hearted and honest man. However, things do happen and he is getting older. I am in no financial position to be able to help him cover his mortgage payment even partially, as I have my own rent and expenses to worry about. I also worry how this will impact my debt to income ratio as well as my future. I'm planning on getting married to my boyfriend of four years in the near future and for us to buy our first home together. My heart is so torn because I really want to help my family since my dad is really struggling with his current mortgage rate since his home's taxes/insurance have gone up.

I have encouraged my dad to try to find another job but he worries that he is getting too old and that he is struggling to keep up with technology. I have tried to get him to increase his prices for his contracting work but he worries that his clients will then go find someone else to work with... even though he delivers high quality and honest work and I'm pretty sure he charges the lowest rates in his area.

We spoke with a family friend of ours who is a real estate broker and he told us that I can build my credit profile by co-signing on the mortgage and that future creditors will find my credit profile to be more attractive by doing this so it would be no problem for future home loans. He also told us that since my name would be on the loan, I could also help my dad apply for Homestead Exemption so that his taxes could be lowered (I'm a citizen, he is not a permanent resident yet therefore he is currently ineligible). My dad is currently still waiting for his green card to be processed (his petition was approved) however USCIS is completely behind due to COVID. 

My dad said that he wants the house to go to my sister and I anyways and he intends to put us on the deed for the house.

My gut is telling me that co-signing isn't a good idea but my heart is telling me that I am obligated to help my family.

I was thinking of asking my aunt (dad's sister) for help since her and her husband are well off. Their kids have graduated from college and are out of the house. My dad doesn't want to ask them for help since according to him, they have helped him numerous times in the past and he doesn't want to inconvenience them. Other than that we don't have any other family members to ask.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you kindly.",1632187192
2,personalfinance,Should I be taking out more credit?,"I’m a student, 20, no real expenses. My parents have assured me time and time again that I’ll have my needs met until I graduate - rent, phone, car insurance, etc…

My credit score is good, hovering around 740. It should go up soon though, as i’ve recently upped my limit from $1,000 -&gt; $2,000 through my credit union.

Wondering if I should (or need to) meet with a fiduciary. Quick rundown is that I am 30 years old. SO and I have around 200k in savings. Combined income is around 150-160k gross. We bought a house at the beginning of the year and put 20% down. No real debt other than car payments which are around $650 a month (including insurance) for both of our vehicles Have a baby coming in a few months. I am maxing out my 401k at work. My employer matches 45% up to the yearly limit. I know that having money in my savings is not the right move and am looking to maybe get into some long term investments. I feel I am a moderate to low risk kind of person. Should I meet with a fiduciary who can help me make the right decisions for myself and my family? I didn't really consider it until now, but if I wanted to, I could probably retire when my dad passes away. Could be 20 years, could be sooner. Idk if it is because of the baby coming or what, but I have a bigger urge to get my money right now. I looked at the flow chart in the wiki and I am in the purple section. Would maxing my HSA be good with the baby coming? Again, should I just meet with an advisor to help me out? Thanks!",1632186571
7,personalfinance,Overdraft protection in context of mortgage application,"Hi there! I am currently in the process of waiting to close on a mortgage loan (first-time homebuyer) for a new construction home. I am conditionally approved for the loan, and as the home nears completion, a final approval process is pending. Estimated completion is mid-November. 

I am hoping to understand how overdraft protection fees on bank statements are viewed during the final underwriting process. Typically, after accounting for fixed expenses, I monitor my checking and savings accounts, keeping just enough in my checking account for my variable expenses (e.g. groceries, gas, fun). If additional funds are needed, I will manually transfer from my savings as needed. I do have overdraft protection set up on my checking account, which is linked to my savings account (not a line of credit). 

On my statement from last month, I have a few line items where overdraft protection kicked in due to a miscalculation of my checking balance following POS transactions. Money was auto-transferred from my savings account for these instances to cover the charge. Following a new policy, my bank does charge a $5 fee for these transfers from savings (I was later able to get these waived following a call to my bank). As on other statements, there is a YTD box on my bank statements showing overdraft or NSF instances. For me, since my overdraft protection is linked to my savings, this is blank and reflects 0 instances. 

I am curious how these instances of overdraft protection will be viewed in the context of final underwriting for my loan. I’ve read online that authorized overdraft limits and unauthorized overdrafts tied to a line of credit are viewed negatively as a sign of poor financial management. Does the same apply for allowing overdraft protection to kick in and transfer available funds directly from savings? Clearly, I’m anxious and concerned how this will be interpreted and whether it will jeopardize my approval. 

Any insight and/or clarification would be much appreciated — thanks!",1632185944

She has gone back to work recently, and today she called and asked if I would be willing to co-sign on a car for her.

The problem is, I’m inclined to say no.

15,personalfinance,Home Refinancing Help,"I am trying to refinance my mortgage to get a lower monthly payment. We are currently paying $1,649.50 per month with a 4.5% interest rate.  Our research has narrowed us down to two companies. 

Company A is offering 2.5% interest rate, a total loan of $224,786 (loan costs $3,177.39 and other costs $2,963.56 = $6,140.95) and cash to close of $2,002.53. Company A's monthly payment would be $888.24 +373.38 escrow would equal a final monthly payment of $1,261.62. 

Company B is offering 2.49% interest rate, a total loan of $222,605 (loan costs $$4,208.83 and other costs $1,392.67 = $5,601.50) and cash to close of $1,980.59. Company B's monthly payment would be $878.40 + 373.38 escrow would equal a final monthly payment of $1,251.78.

We had sent Company B the offer from Company A and they agreed to beat it. We have since sent Company A the offer from Company B because Company A wouldn't let it go when we originally tried to cancel.

All these numbers and jargon (plus the pushy sales guys) have me questioning whether Company B is the obvious choice. Company A is still competing for our business and has expressed interest in matching Company B's offer but when we sent over the information, he said: 

""I’m a little confused. The total loan costs for the quote they sent are $4,028. Ours are at $3,177.39. They haven’t included any escrow whatsoever, and in any case, when they do, it will match ours exactly. All lenders end up at the same place with escrow at the end of a loan. The initial estimates are just different. The quote they sent is a bit misleading. What am I missing?""

The documents we sent him DID show an initial escrow payment of $746.66.

I guess I am just wondering if Company A is trying to pull a fast one by making me question Company B and go with them instead by making it sound like Company B is the one trying to be shady!? Am I looking at the wrong numbers to make a comparison and decision? Do I just go with Company B and tell Company A to suck it? I am over the back and forth and just want to make a decision.

16,personalfinance,Saving for a far-off down payment in bond funds - would that make sense? Where to keep medium-term savings?,"I am in my mid 20s with a vague idea of ""it would be nice to own a home someday, maybe"" but with no concrete plan, timeframe, geographical location, budget, etc. Probably minimum 5 years from now, and most likely longer than that.

I've seen people suggest keeping ones down payment savings in bonds. Would this mean purchasing individual bonds? I was raised to believe in mutual/index funds, so I was thinking bond funds. However these would be in my taxable account since I'd need to access the money in the next 20 years. It seems bond funds would generate a lot of taxes there. 

Do people keep bond funds in their taxable account? Would the idea be to keep stock funds in my taxable account and the bond funds in my Roth IRA or some other tax-advantaged fund, and then (1. hopefully the market doesn't crash so far that my whole taxable account is now less than what I had earmarked for my down payment) I would sell some stock funds for the down payment, and then convert the bond funds in my IRA to stock and keep my overall asset allocation what I want it to be now that the down payment is gone? Should I just put this money, or half this money, in a savings account making 0.5%, and accept that that's the way forward for a down payment?

*Additional information about me that might not be useful: I'm perfectly happy renting, probably don't want to buy until I'm married/have a family which is not necessarily going to be anytime soon. I max out my Roth IRA and HSA, and put a good chunk into my 401k but am not maxing that. I don't really want to take anything out of my Roth principal, and I wouldn't necessarily want to take a 401K loan though I've seen that advocated for.*

I plan to have a better job sometime next year.I’m studying accounting, will be graduating with an associates this December, and a bachelors in 2023.

I recently paid off all of my cc debt. I fell on some hard times while taking care of my mom (she had heart surgery and beat Covid twice, she’s also disabled), going to college and working full time. I have a $500 emergency fund, and I save roughly $250 each check.

I also have $250 car insurance, $70 phone bill, pay the electricity bill, gas, etc. I have no debt aside from some student loans, which I’ll start paying 2023. I also throw some money at them now and again. My SO’s main bills are car insurance, car payment, and phone bill. She doesn’t have any debt aside from the car payment.

39,personalfinance,Currently paying $140 every 3 months to get an Adderall refill. Help.,"Note: This is in the U.S. (of course)

This has been going on for a while and I'm not even sure if this is the right sub for this but I'm so annoyed. For those who aren't aware, because Adderall is a Schedule II restricted drug, you can't have it set up to automatically refill like other medications. Instead, you have to go into the doctor's office every single time you need a 'refill' and get a new prescription for it. It seems like most doctors skirt this by maually writing out three 30 day prescriptions that can't be filled out early and then having the patient fill them separately each month to get a new 30 day refill (that's a separate annoyance that I won't get into).

The issue is that I'm under 26 and still using my parents' insurance plan (Anthem/Blue Cross Blue Shield). My dad's work only offers a high deductible plan (and even if it had other options, he makes very good money and would rather save his money than pay extra to save on the deductible, which I understand). Because it's a high deductible plan, most of my visits aren't covered by the deductible, and I pay most of the cost out of pocket. Right now it's like $140 *every single visit*. And they aren't even full visits to the office, they're televisits. 

The actual Adderall pills themselves don't even cost that much. Is there any way to knock this down somehow??? It's not even a full appointment; I get on a call with the doctor, she asks me if I'm having any problems with my medication, I say no, and then she writes me a prescription for three months. It's not even a five minute call. I don't mind paying some kind of administration fee or something but I'm paying $140 every single time I get a prescription filled.

I tried to talk to my doctor about this and she didn't even understand or believe me until I showed her the bill. I don't think she really understands how the billing department or insurance works so I'm trying to figure out if there's anyone else I can talk to because this seems insane to me.",1632179838

42,personalfinance,How to weigh financial windfall options involving student loans?,"My wife and I are in the processing of buying a new house and selling our current one. We are under contract on both and got a terrific offer for our current home and so should be receiving an higher than expected windfall from the sales proceeds. I know, things can always change before close but we're trying to assess options now.

We'll likely have \~$100K in proceeds and would love any advice on how to attack some debts/fund other projects. We meet a lot of suggested goals (6 mo em savings, max Roths, get employer match for 401K). We're both in our early 30s with two kids.

 Some options we're weighing are:

* Put 10% more equity in our new house ($50K) and recast (not refi) the loan ($150 fee) to lower our P&amp;I and remove PMI ($80/month).
* Pay off car loan $7.5K at 3.5%
* We have $76K combined in student loan debt, all federal and varying interest rates (highest is 6%). We're both in PSLF (6 years in for me, 4 years for wife) and I'm wary of making any extra payments on these until we get clarification about yes/no on any debt cancellation and/or any changes to the PSLF program. I'd hate to pay a big chunk and then hear it would've be forgiven 6 months later. Would it make sense to set aside a portion of the windfall in some sort of investment vehicle and just withdraw a few times a year to set aside for our monthly income based repayment?
* Just invest a good portion of the windfall in various mutual funds/ETFs that cover wide swaths of the market.

43,personalfinance,I have two mortgages for the same property. Can I refinance just one of them?,"Bought a house last year with my parents in CA.

The one upside has been that we were able to avoid PMI this way. But the insane interest rate on the smaller mortgage is killing me. 

So. My question is can we refinance just the smaller mortgage? The mortgages are both in my name and my dad's.

44,personalfinance,Got rid of PMI and lowered rate,"I have had some friends tell me they haven’t considered doing this and it worked well for us so I figured I would share with this community:

We bought our home in June 2020 for 400k.  Put less than 20% down so we had to have PMI.

Now we have had our home for over a year and the value has gone up due to the market.  I contacted our mortgage company and asked about the possibility of removing PMI since our home is valued at more and we may already have 20% equity.

Mortgage company ran a credit report and was able to confirm our home is worth at least 485k now. 

We lowered our rate from 3.375 to 2.99 and got rid of our PMI, all this saves us almost $300 a month. We don’t have to pay anything out of pocket and will likely not have a payment for a month when the new mortgage kicks in.

47,personalfinance,"Combining personal savings, gift money, and a family loan for mortgage down payment","I'm looking to buy my first home in 6-9 months from now. I've been financially independent from my parents for many years now, but I've realized there is no way I can save up for a 20% down payment in my area (Western U.S.) all on my own in a reasonable timeframe. Yes, I could put down less, but I'd like to avoid PMI. Yes, I could wait longer, but I don't want to get trapped in the renting/trying to save vortex b/c the rent is too damn high and home prices here will plateau at best; it's a highly desirable area so I only see things going up.

Based on my gross income of \~$80k/year with no outstanding debts, most calculations I've run estimate I could comfortably afford something around $400k, so would need \~$80k for a down payment. 

Despite my wanting to do things on my own attitude, I think pragmatism has beat my pride. So my folks have generously offered to help me with the down payment with a combination of gift money and a loan. I know a married couple can gift $30k/year w/o having to file a gift tax return. I plan to use \~$20-25k of my own savings and the rest (\~$25-30k) would be a loan from them to be paid back over a fixed time.

* My main questions surround how gifts and loans from family members work and the potential tax implications? I know lenders will care if part of the money is a loan since it affects my ability to pay the mortgage in their eyes.
* Would the loan need to have interest to avoid negative tax consequences?
* Is it better to deposit the gift funds months in advance so they are 'seasoned'?
* Any advice from people who have used loans and/or gifts from family members for their down payments?

So I go into the local PF and see if they can pull up my account. It's not my home location, so it's a whole issue.

Anyway--manager at new PF helps me get the information fixed, but I now have late fees and the yearly fee from when my account SHOULD have been cancelled that PF is saying I must pay before I can cancel. Manager at new PF told me that PF doesn't report to collections........and that he shouldn't tell me to just keep it as it is (they're blocked from charging me), but in my position he would probably not pay and just keep it blocked on my account.

Income is $105k/yr (take home is about $5k/mo after benefits &amp; 401k)
800+ credit, no debt.

After lots of research and searching, I’m set to close on a home next month at $325,000 with 5% down. 
I aimed for a mortgage around 28% of my net income  ($1,555/mo) but it’s wound up at $1,710/mo.

While it’s a great place for me and my child (plenty of space, good neighborhood, house is turnkey), I can’t help but feel like I’m stretching myself with a mortgage at 35% of my net.

Does this budget seem reasonable?

Mortgage (+ interest, taxes, insurance, PMI): $1,710
Utilities, life insurance, medical copays, other: $800
Basics (groceries, gas, clothes, home): $900
Flex (Netflix, gifts, beer, etc): $300
Savings (529, Investments, home/car maintenance, etc): $950

I work in tech so my salary has room to grow, but I don’t want to rely on that.

I potentially can increase my down payment from 5% to 10%, which would drop the mortgage to $1,630/mo. 

Or I can walk away from everything and lose my down payment of 5k….

35k in brokerage account

56,personalfinance,Looking for advice/critiques of my family's financial plan,"My wife and I have one child and one on the way and we are wanting to be more responsible with our household budget/financial plan. Unfortunately, we don't have people in our lives that we feel comfortable discussing finances with. We're both fairly conscientious when it comes to money, but knowing that we'll soon have another mouth to feed is causing us to want to make sure we have our act together. Below I'll lay out our financial situation/plan and would appreciate feedback on how we're doing and where we could/should be doing better.

We are both 29 years old and work in a midwest college town in the U.S. Our household income is approximately $104,000/year. We currently have $24,000 in savings, $65,000 in retirement and no debt except for our house. We owe $201,000 on the house and it's worth \~$310-$315K. Our mortgage is $1445/month. We also pay $150/week for daycare. This will double to $300/week in about 7 months. As of right now, we are putting a combined $1,339 (including company match) into 401K/Roth IRA accounts each month.

This year, we completed a renovation (finished basement) and have just now returned our emergency fund back to the $24,000 range we'd like it to be at. Our plan currently is to continue adding to the emergency fund each month until the baby comes in order to cover expenses. Fortunately, we will not have a hospital bill due to very good health insurance. Unfortunately, my wife does not get any paid maternity leave so we will go a few months without her salary, which makes up half our household income. 

Once we are through her maternity leave, hopefully at or above the 24K mark in our emergency fund, our plan is to put whatever savings we have each month toward paying off the house early. We would eventually like more space, and would like to buy a bigger house within the next 8-10 years. In order to do that, I'm hoping we can build up plenty of equity in our current home. I know the math says to invest rather than pay the house off early, but we're risk-averse and our dream is to some day be mortgage-free.

1) Job offer itself - are there any unique considerations I should consider for a contract from the EU/Netherlands? What are typical benefits? EU equivalent of 401k/employer retirement contributions? 

2) Relocation negotiations - wife and I would both be relocating. We are on the east coast and own a home (mortgaged) and 2 cars (one still with a loan). Any idea on what sort of absolute $ number I should be looking for with relocation help, or specific areas of assistance that could be negotiable?

3) tying up of US-loose ends - selling house, cars, major appliances, furniture... etc. Pretty much will be re-starting materially in Europe save for our clothing and personal items, save for some items of sentimental value we will be storing w/ family.

4) Actual finances - implications of keeping US bank accounts, retirement and investment accounts. Benefits of consolidating these.

- First, I want to get my total emergency funds to 5k (includes the 2k checking buffer). This will only take a month or two. Since I am at no risk for unemployment, I think this small of of an EF might be ok. Thoughts?
- Then, start contributing to a moderate sinking fund for one-time purchases (new computer, plane tickets, etc.) and a large fund for when I have to move in five years after graduation. This likely includes a car.
- Interested in opening a Roth IRA. I won't be able to max it out $6k yearly but I can get it started.
- Interested in building credit. (Will not spend above my means, will pay off in full each month). As I have none, I will probably need a secured or student card, yes?

I'm interested in advice regarding my current budget (I know the rent/bills is too high for my income but my current apartment is perfect in terms of several important metrics and is very cheap for the area), and if my interests are appropriate, comprehensive, and in the proper order of priority. **Advice regarding the Roth IRA and CC would be especially appreciated.**

Thank you, I hope this was clear and includes all the necessary information. Will be happy to answer questions especially because I'm still a beginner with financial literacy so I'm sure I probably said something very dumb at some point.",1632172797
68,personalfinance,Public College Changing Tuition During Semester,"My public college that I recently enrolled in changed the cost of the courses that I registered for this term. The cause of the change was an error in the school's system that made me appear as an in-state student when I'm actually out-of-state. The term started about a month ago, they notified me last week about the error, and added the balance of out of state tuition to my account. I was wondering if I'm even obligated to pay the remaining balance. I'm afraid if I don't pay by next month, they'd send it to collections and/or take me out of classes. Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences?

Additionally, I think I may be eligible for in state tuition with a new state sponsored policy and I am trying to pursue that option. The college employee that notified me of the change is the one I'm trying to work this option with, but they have been dodging me for the last few days. Today is the third business day of no response; even after making positive contact today only to be told they'd call me right back. 

This is my first post here and wasn't sure if it'd belong on here or /r/legaladvice. I'll try there too if this isn't a fitting post for this subreddit.

Tldr; should I pay the change of college tuition for this term because the school's system had an error and considered me in-state?",1632172713

72,personalfinance,Roth vs Traditional IRA - minimum match contribution due to funds?,"Hi all - I have a question about my 401K offered. I have not had one previously and just wanted to see if I understand correctly. 

Current situation:

29/single tax filer

65k/annual. I currently supplement this with a side business so having liquid is good/I get decent returns on any cash I hold liquid -  made around 10k/on the side. 

12K HSA

55K Roth IRA

330k taxable brokerage (Tsla/AMD/CRWD/VTI/VTSAX)

15k liquid

/roughly 410-415,000 Net worth with around 1600/monthly expenses (2000-2400 to save plus the 300/hsa contribution plus whatever cash I pull in on the side - around 10k last year with an llc)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 4% match on my 401k - my company provider offers vanguard funds which I'm predisposed to . 

&amp;#x200B;

In deciding on a roth vs a traditional IRA - the advantage is when taxes are drawn. As I project my NW to be substantially higher upon retirement/by 59.5 - I should assume the roth would hold an advantage. That being said -

&amp;#x200B;

Does the employer match sit on top of the annual contribution limit? I.E if my annual limit is 19500 would the employer match be 4% of my salary on top of that? (i.e 65k\*.04 = 2600 + 19500 = a total of 22100)? 

Also - as I see the most savings for the first 5% (4% match - 2600 in +a free 2600) - past that does it really make a lot of sense to max it out all the way priority wise? To me my roth IRA should be priority as it's already a much higher sum - I could potentially max this year still by contributing my full paycheck the next 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated! I'm just trying to set myself up for the best potential future scenario.

75,personalfinance,Legally changed my name- unable to apply for credit now.,"I have absolutely no idea where to turn right now.

After years of dealing with an extremely abusive mother, I finally decided to legally change my entire name. (I had moved out of state years ago, but she continued to harass me and my workplace).

Name change was granted earlier this year. I didn't have any issues until just recently.

I mainly use my debit card through my bank. Only *had* one charge card that I used for gas and groceries. Payed it in full every month. Over time I got my credit all the way up to 750.

However, after much frustration and heartache, I finally had to close my credit card account. For whatever reason, they couldn't understand a simple name change. They kept adding me on as an authorized user, but kept the account user name the same. So every time I'd go in person to the bank, or called on the phone, they would refuse to talk to me because I wasn't the account holder (even though I was).

So I go to apply for a different credit card. Nothing fancy, just a simple, low-interest card to cover my groceries and gas.

I get denied. Again and again. For literally every card. Even the 'bottom of the barrel' cards for people with no credit, despite having a 750 score.

My name's been updated with the credit bureaus. My checking account at BofA is in my new legal name.

I literally have zero idea what to do. Although I can theoretically live without a credit card... what happens when I go to buy my next car? Apply for a mortgage?

Just scared at this point, and need to be pointed in the right direction.",1632171431

85,personalfinance,Home refinance advice,"I am considering refinancing my home. My credit score is solidly in the mid-700s. We closed last March right before the world shut down with a house we (luckily) got under appraisal value at a 4% rate. This is a 30 year conventional loan with a fixed rate. Since then our market has continued to explode. I would conservatively estimate that my home value has increased at least $40k over the past year and a half based on homes that have sold in our neighborhood.

The goal of refinancing would be a lower monthly payment with another 30 year conventional loan. Tentatively looking it looks like I would get a 3.25% rate or better, although I have not shopped around very hard yet. I would be able to drop my PMI which is about $65/month. I would be able to save a little money on my P&amp;I. I am also paying about $250 every month extra on top of my mortgage for the sole purpose of getting ahead on my equity. At this point the market has done that for me and I would like to make that money work for me in other ways at this point.

In addition to that, I have almost maxed out my credit card that is $1500. I am nervous that both of these things are going to prevent me from being able to rent? 

The other factor, I laid off from my previous job and was involved in car accident last November. Someone rear ended me and it ended up totaling my car! Because of that situation, I had to purchase a new car but bc of my debt in collections my car payment is high - $454. I did secure a new job, but I have not been able to catch up on debt all of the way but want to refinance my auto loan to reduce my payments!

I’m considering taking out a personal loan for about $2500 to pay off both my collections debt and credit card? I don’t know if I will qualify for a loan with a local credit union, but I have qualified for a loan with Upstart. Is it absolutely a horrible idea to get a loan through them?",1632170406

96,personalfinance,Vanguard Wellesley in retirement,"Hi everyone. I'd like to get some thoughts on Vanguard Wellesley as the bulk of a retirement portfolio.

I'm 44 now, planning to be able to retire at 55. Currently I'm invested 75% VTSAX and 25% VFWAX. I'm planning to glide path to my retirement allocation over the next decade, so looking what that may be now. 

Right now I'm clearly pretty aggressive being all in equities, and I have had no problem with that since I had plenty of time to recover losses by retirement. As I near retirement though, sequence of returns risk is a bigger concern than rate of return, so I was thinking my portfolio would be much more conservative. Playing around on Portfolio Visualizer, I found that my best success rates came from being heavily invested in Vanguard Wellesley (using VWINX as a proxy to get the longest historical data), to the point that using VWIAX almost exclusively gave the best success chance. Of course this comes at the cost of lower portfolio at death, but I think my heirs will be alright. I was thinking of a portfolio of 80-90% VWIAX, 5-15% VTSAX, and 5% Cash.

Granted, this looks at historical performance, which as we all know is no guarantee of future returns, but VWIAX is a very proven fund, and seems pretty well diversified by design.

98,personalfinance,Confusion with Mortgage: Am I owed Money? [UK],"Hi,

This is a bit of a strange one, but I'm hoping if anyone has experience with mortgages (more-so than me - a first time buyer!) they might be able to advise if I'm owed my Completion Fee back.

I went through a Mortgage Broker to get my mortgage - who is now on maternity leave, so I'm not sure how long I'd be waiting to hear back from them. Though I think deep down my issue is with either the Mortgage Provider (HSBC) or my solicitors.

So here's quick breakdown (I've removed Solicitor fees, as they're not in question).

* I was allowed to borrow up to £188,400 and my property was £211,500
* So my deposit was £23,100 as I borrowed the (above) full amount
* I'd originally asked for the Booking fee of £999 to be put on top of my mortgage (not knowing I would eventually borrow the full amount amount available)
* I sent the solicitor my deposit of £23,100 one week before completion
* Two days before completion the Solicitor emailed saying the Mortgage Provider (HSBC) had deducted the £999 like I'd asked, meaning I was going to need to make up the shortfall in order to complete in two days time. So the **new** Mortgage Advance on my Financial Statement from my solicitor was now £189,399.
* I sent them an extra £999, thinking that's fine it'll just be removed from my Mortgage, as that booking fee is now essentially lumped in with my deposit
* I've now got my first Mortgage Statement and it shows I owe £188,400 ***and*** £999 on top

Surely that £999 should be removed, or has my solicitor got confused with my bank trying to add the fee on top of the mortgage, which was never possible with borrowing being maxed?

What I've done so far:

1. I've phoned the bank, who explained the £999 was added because I'd asked for it to be added, but it was outside of my maximum amount available.
2. Phoned the Solicitors who were very little help and said speak to the bank.

I think my next step needs to be to phone the bank in the morning again and ask how much they sent to the Seller's solicitor.

I went to my Barclays Branch in January 2018 and closed my account. I was not using it after moving to Halifax and after some issues with them I was happy to be out of their terrible customer service.
Closed the account, told them to cancel any renaming direct debits etc. They offered to send me multiple statements (something they said they have to do after a closed account) I declined and they said that's ok they have to offer. 

Well..
They didn't close it.
They continued to take my monthly charge- despite my account having NO over draft it is now £97 in debt? I assume if they are taking money for themselves they can go into an overdraft even though there wasn't one!!!
They closed the account some time later and reported me not at the address. (Obviously as I thought the account was closed no new address given to them)
They also allowed a direct debit to Dog's Trust go through (only one month) which I was told over the phone was because it was a charity?

I was under the impression my account was cold and all DDs cancelled from Jan 2018.

After joining Experian today I have seen the £97 overdraft debt and the default on my credit from Sept 2018.

After speaking to them (very difficult when you don't remember the details to an account supposedly closed years ago) the woman told me and I quote 
'If you pay me the full £97 now it will improve your credit and the default won't be a problem'

I asked her if, given it was their error, they would remove the defaults as she claimed my credit would be improved and no longer affected by the default if I pay today.

She said 'no one has the power to remove the defaults and even if it is an error, which I see no evidence of on the system, the default will stay' .

I personally have an emergency fund for just myself (in case I lost my job) for 6 months. I am using a zero-based budget ( so potential expenses are also being saved for), have no CC debt, and am working at knocking out my $16,000 student loan in the next few years. At the same time, I want to save in order to cushion myself and my family if anything happens or as they enter my household. My parent is on SSI due to disability. Is anyone saving to take care of others? How much should I be setting aside and saving in preparation? or are there resources out there to help calculate these costs? Also, where are you putting this money (High Yield Savings account or Index fund)? I know there are unknown potential emergencies that can happen with an older parent, I am just looking at a sense of how to prepare. Perhaps there are others here who live in a multigenerational household and are making a similar plan?",1632166952

It is referred to as my car and I handle the oil changes, car problems, etc. The agreement was that when I got settled in my new state, I would take over the insurance as well. My new state requires that new residents register within 10 days of arrival and I have heard stories from people about getting fined for having out of state plates so I definitely wanted to get this taken care of.


That was when I discovered that I was left off of the title, meaning I cannot register the car at the DMV. I spoke with the bank holding the lien and they told me that only my father was on the title. I then spoke with the dealership who sold me the car and they broke down how to transfer the car to me - mainly, pay it off and have my parents gift it to me so I can avoid taxes. 


I immediately went to my parents and told them that I wanted to pay it off as quickly as possible and they needed to tell me how much was left on the payments so I could transfer it to them. I have the means to pay this off through savings so it's not like I'd be in the red. My parents have been hemming and hawing about this, refusing to give me a clear answer.

They said it's more of an issue for people with Oregon plates because they will go up there and buy cars tax-free (??). I live in an Oregon adjacent state but I don't live near Oregon.

33,personalfinance,Potential IPO + Maybe leaving during lockout period,"I’d like to preface this by saying that I am absolutely clueless when it comes to stocks, buying/selling, etc.

My employer will likely public soon and I’m struggling to manage next steps regarding my stocks. Details below!

* 13,000 options originally granted.
* 6,500 have vested out of 13,000
* stake price is at ($2.51)
* Fair market value is at (14.11) pre-IPO, is anticipated to increase once IPO is finalized 
* We can sell 15% of what we have VESTED in the first 3 days of IPO
   * We can sell an additional 15% provided our stock price increases a certain amount in a month
* Open to sell any quantity after 180 day lockout period 
* One thing to note is I may leave the company during the 180 day lockout period. If so, I will have 90 days to exercise and hold my stock until the lockout period is complete.
* We'll be offered stock with a discount from the market due to a two year ""lookback"" provision (which I don't really understand but seems to provide a theoretical discount compared to the regular market price)

I am really struggling with next steps. When asking for advice at the company we're given generic advice and are asked to talk to a tax advisor -\_-. 

Would it make sense to exercise all of my shares now? Maybe exercise only 15% so that I could sell within those first three days and then exercise little by little over the following 6 months unless I leave early, then i'll have to decide it I want to exercise and hold vs letting the vested options expire...? If all goes well I may be able to sell 30% of my vested options before leaving / could use that income to invest further...

Exercising all shares will cost me a fair amount, especially when the price goes up once we IPO. I'm a little concerned that doing that will deplete my savings to the point where leaving my current job and being unemployed a few months would be a little risky / 15% will only cost me somewhere around is more reasonable. I don't have debt / have built up my savings to 35k in the hopes of making some funds off the IPO before I leave the company.

34,personalfinance,Capital gains taxes - how to minimize them (and why you might not be able to),"""I have $X in capital gains and am looking at a huge tax bill. How can I minimize this?""

This question comes up a lot, and with the rise of meme stocks, crypto currency, etc., a lot more people are coming with similar questions. This is my attempt to make a single post to collect the wisdom on this topic. **This post is aimed primarily at US taxpayers with gains in stocks or options purchased on the open market, or cryptocurrency.** If your gains are related to either real estate or stocks that you're receiving as compensation, you might have more options - see the appendix.

I will assume that you understand the basics of capital gains taxation. If not, Investopedia has a good introduction: [https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/), but the most important takeaways are the difference between short-term and long-term gains, and the fact that for both types of gains your taxes go up the more income you realize in any single tax year.

**Now, to the answer: how do you minimize capital gains taxes?**

Mostly, you can't. Just getting this out of the way. There's no magic bullet to erase taxes; if there were then everyone would use it and the tax code would be meaningless and eventually the holes would be closed. But you can lessen the impact with some careful planning, and if you're really motivated (i.e. we're talking about a lot of money) there  are some ways, but all of these methods require *significant sacrifices* and most of them additionally require *significant amounts of pre-planning*.

But lets get the easy methods out of the way.

**Good techniques to reduce your capital gains taxes:**

* Hold your assets until they meet long-term gains criteria (&gt;1 year between acquisition and sale).
* If you have any investments that have lost value, sell those in the same year you are realizing gains. If you have more gains than losses, you can realize all of your losses and offset an equivalent amount of gains.
* Sell as gradually as possible. The best way to minimize taxes is to keep your income as even as possible year-to-year to avoid crossing into higher tax brackets.
* Get ahead of the problem by practicing tax-gain harvesting in low income years. Between the 12k standard deduction and the 40k 0% long-term cap gains bracket, you can sell your assets and immediately re-purchase them to establish a new higher cost basis.
* Use your available pre-tax accounts to cut down on taxable income. Your pretax 401k is the main way to do this, and if you qualify for an HSA that gives you additional pretax savings capacity.
* A CPA can help you map out all of the above if you don't feel like trying to run the numbers yourself.

**What about charitable donations?**

When you donate to charity, you can theoretically deduct that from your taxes, but it's important to note that this does not result in more money in your pocket. You are giving away $X but reducing your tax bill by &lt;less than $X&gt; so it still remains a net loss for you. If you do wish to support charity, though, then doing so in a year in which you have big capital gains is a great time to do so.

There are two ways you can enhance the power of your giving. 

* The first is to donate appreciated assets directly instead of selling them for cash. When you do so, you increase the power of your deduction because you not only avoid paying any taxes on the unrealized gains, you can also claim a deduction for the full value of the assets you contribute. In effect you get a double deduction equal to the unrealized appreciation in your assets (plus the single deduction of your cost basis.
* The second is to utilize a Donor-Advised Fund. By giving to a DAF, you are able to claim a full tax deduction in the current tax year but you don't have to decide right away where all of the money goes. You can leave the funds waiting to be distributed at some later date, and even invest them for additional growth in the meanwhile. Fidelity &amp; Schwab both run DAFs with low minimums.

Note that charitable donation is still limited to a percentage of your AGI, and only benefits you to the extent you are itemizing your deductions. A CPA, again, can help map out exactly how the numbers would work for you.

**Yeah, but none of that works for me. What are advanced techniques I can use?**

All of the above is well and good, but if you need to sell soon, and you don't have losses to offset, and you're already maxing your 401k, then none of that will actually help you. This is where we get to the problem I mentioned: there are no really good ways to help you beyond this, ***and the best answer for most people is just to pay their taxes and move on****.* But if you want to explore all your options, here is a running list of ways to cut down on capital gains taxes. Note that the first 3 here all require significant amounts of pre-planning. If you're talking about gains you have already realized in the current tax year, you can skip down the list to number 4.

1. Sell through a **Charitable Remainder Trust.** A CRT is a special purpose vehicle you create with the help of a lawyer. You transfer your appreciated assets into the trust, at which point you can sell them without incurring an immediate tax bill. The proceeds remain within the trust, and can even be reinvested, and are disbursed back to you over a predetermined schedule with a set formula for handling of income. You will still pay capital gains taxes, but only when the money is transferred from the trust to you, which can keep you in lower tax brackets. But the catch is that you must commit a portion of your value to charity, and there are strict legal requirements around how the payoff schedule can be structured. CRTs come in various forms (CRATs, CRUTs) and are highly complicated. A consultation with a knowledgeable lawyer would be necessary to explore this.
2. Sell through a **Deferred Sales Trust.** This is somewhat similar to a CRT, in that you first transfer assets into a trust, which can then liquidate them but then distribute the assets to you over time. And unlike a CRT, a DST does not require specific formulas or a charitable interest. But it has a major drawback: a DST cannot be something you control. You must hand over control of the trust to an external trustee (someone not connected with you), letting them make investment decisions and charging a (probably substantial) fee for their service. DSTs are a highly bespoke legal structure and you can expect to pay hefty fees to set up and maintain them.
3. Move to **Puerto Rico**. Residents of PR are exempt from federal capital gains tax, but there are some big exceptions here. A big one is that this does not apply to stock gains that were accrued before you moved to the island. If you're sitting on huge $ in your appreciated stocks, that will remain taxable even if you wait until you move to sell. PR is a better option for crypto investors, because crypto is currently treated as property rather than an investment and thus qualifies for the tax exemption. But to take advantage of this, you must jump through all the hoops to establish PR as your true tax home; you cannot just take a long vacation there. If you are interested in this, you should look for a tax lawyer knowledgable with it. The /r/act2022 subreddit may have additional resources for you.
4. Reinvest in a **Qualified Opportunity Zone**. QOZs are regions of the US that the government has targeted for economic revival, and has incentivized this by giving investors a deferral on gains taxes if they reinvest in a business within the QOZ. It's important to note that this is a *deferral,* not an exemption; you will still owe taxes on those gains by the end of 2026. This may help if you want to cut your gains in half, for example; you can realize some now and punt the rest 5 years out. This also gets you 5 years in which your gains can continue growing, so there is some compounding growth benefit. But there are (again) many caveats here. Finding an appropriate investment is challenging; you must invest in a business that meets certain community criteria and thus accept a lot of risk. You can invest indirectly by giving your money to a Qualified Opportunity Fund that invests in businesses for you, but you will incur management fees by doing so, and you're still taking on risk. You could find your investment losing more value than your tax benefits.
5. Start **your own business** with a big upfront capital cost. This is the most dangerous approach, because the IRS takes a hard look at anyone claiming aggressive tax write-offs in a business's early years, especially if you're spending the money on lifestyle things like cars or real estate. And, of course, this approach also does not put more money in your pocket;  you still need to commit $X to save &lt;less than $X&gt; on taxes. And if your business does not turn profitable, or if the IRS decides it's really a hobby, you risk an audit that wipes out your deduction entirely and leaves you paying taxes on money you no longer have.

So there you have it: most of the ways to minimize or defer cap gains taxes come with huge drawbacks.

**Appendix A - What about real estate?**

With real estate, you have much better options, depending on whether we're talking about your personal residence or an investment property.

With your **personal residence**, you are entitled to exempt the first 250k of capital gains on the sale of your home, and it's doubled to 500k for a married couple. This exemption requires that you have both lived in and owned the home for 2 of the last 5 years. If you are moving out sooner than 2 years, then you still might qualify for a smaller exemption if you moved for reasons related to job or health. Pub 523 has more info: [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701)

With **investment properties,** you can use something called a ""1031 exchange"" to sell a property and re-invest your proceeds without paying any taxes. 1031 exchanges are complicated and have a lot of caveats; talking an experienced accountant is advised if you want to go this route.

**Appendix B - What about stock options I received from my employer, and which might become very valuable in the near future?**

Normally, stock-based compensation is treated as income in the year you receive it, or in which you become able to sell it (e.g. when your company IPOs). However, if you anticipate a lucrative future payday from company stock grants, you can look at doing what is called an ""83b election."" This allows you to pay tax on the value of your stock today (and if you have options instead of just stock, this lets you exercise them and hold the stock) . Later on, when the stock is sold after IPO or some other liquidity event, the gains in value from the date of the 83b will be treated as capital gains rather than income, and if more than a year has passed they will be treated as long-term gains complete with a lower tax rate. This can greatly reduce the taxation on a big IPO payday.

However, there is a big catch - if the stock later becomes worthless, you can only claim a capital loss based on what you actually paid for the stock. If your company folds rather than succeeds, you will have paid taxes on income you never received with no way to recover it.",1632164743

53,personalfinance,"Car stolen, credit score took a hit?","So a year ago my leased car was stolen right in front of my apartment. The vehicle wasn’t found right away (actually found about 6 months later but was the insurance companies responsibility at that point) and so i began the process of communicating with my insurance company and the leasing company. This seemed pretty standard as I’m sure I’m not the only one to get their car stolen. After a few weeks my insurance assured me that they have paid off the lease as well as the rest of the vehicle. Shortly after, my leasing company contacted me agreeing with this statement but there was a $400 gap that I had to somehow pay for. I argued this for a bit but I figured it’s better than paying for the entire car and went ahead and paid it. After that I was assured by both parties that this was “case closed” and i was free from the car. 

A few months later I noticed that my credit took a huge hit (~150 points). I don’t have robust credit as I’ve never owned a home and have only had a couple credit cards for a few years, but I couldn’t understand what happened as I’ve never missed a payment and always pay in full. After digging through Credit Karma for awhile I found that this auto loan was listing the last two months as “charged off” and therefore giving the account a derogatory mark/status. I contacted my leasing company to ask about this as I had never missed a payment and everything had been paid in full. I probably called about 30 times and was hung up on, transferred constantly, and no one understood what I was asking. They once even transferred me to the collections office who had no record of me ever being there (because I paid in full, imagine that). I finally got transferred to someone who was able to see this from my point of view and assured me that he would look into it further. I got a call from them soon after apologizing that they had found mistakes on their end and they were working on fixing it and would let the credit bureaus know of this mistake. They even sent me documentation on this mistake that I could use to dispute any credit issues with this account. I disputed with all three bureaus and in a couple months things were looking up as my credit score went back to normal one by one. 

That brings us to about a month ago when I saw my credit drop again, for the exact same reason. Somehow all the changes that were made had been reverted. I once again disputed with the credit bureaus with the documents I had been sent  and they would fix this issue just to have it reverted once again about a week later. After talking with the credit bureaus they all agreed that they were “reporting what they have been told by the leasing company”. I contacted the leasing company about this and everyone I talked to assured me that the account “looks fine” but they would try sending an update to the credit bureaus. Nothing has changed, it’s been a year now and nobody seems to have a solution that’ll stick and I’m looking to try and buy a house and I’d like another car but with the way my credit is sitting I don’t think I’ll be able to. What do I do?

55,personalfinance,Opening a Schwab Account and I'm afraid of the hard pull,"Hi hi everyone! I believe this is my first post on here. I was hoping to ask for some advice or some wisdom. I come from a family that's not very financially literate, so I'm trying to do this on my own as well. 

I've been very interested and on the verge of opening a checking account with Schwab. Although small, I can gain interest on my debit balance, and there's no foreign transaction fees if I understood that correctly, which is great because I study in upstate New York and would like to head over to Canada sometimes (hopefully frequent there in the future). Also, if I travel to other places in the future or study abroad, I think it would just be very useful. I like these perks.

However, I'm 19 and recently opened one credit account back in January of this year. I've been working on building my credit, and I'd say it's pretty healthy. I'm still lost on how to really check it thoroughly, but I think I'm in pretty good shape. Lack of suspicious activity. But, opening an account with Schwab Does result in a hard pull if you're a brand new customer (the representative who got in touch with me over the phone confirmed this). 

It would just be one hard pull, but I was wondering if it would be quite bad for my score. They last a while, and I don't know if I might have to apply for a student loan or an apartment next year. From what I've read online, I seem to be in the clear and this is just fine- but I'm still not entirely sure. I'm also surprised at why Schwab does a hard pull for checking accounts, since it doesn't have to do with credit, but oh well. I included some information above as to why I would really like to get the card, to see if the perks outweigh getting a hard pull. I'm just not very familiar with How bad a hard pull may be...

We are financially stable (my spouse and I), and are looking to become financially independent within 10 years since we are in our mid-twenties. We have no debt (outside of the home), have a solid year’s worth of expenses in our emergency fund, both employed full time, investing in our 401k, pension and IRAs, and maxing out our HSA. Our goal is to hit financial independence so we can raise a family without relying on a dual income. 
I just want to know why there is so much negativity surrounding a person working two jobs for a short amount of time (1 or 2 years) to reach their goals. We want to steadily invest but pay off the mortgage as quickly as possible. We are risk averse and prefer security over projected gains. Thank you in advance!

87,personalfinance,Should I Pay Off My Student Loans or Continue Saving for a Home?,"I find myself in, admittedly a confusing situation for myself and not sure what direction I should go.

I'm currently sitting on 20k of federal loans that are in forbearance with 0% interest until January 2022. This is my only debt. I have no car payment, and no CC debt. 

I'm pulling in $57k before taxes. 11% put into 401k and I have maxed my Roth IRA for the year (from a previous job rollover)

I have 6 month emergency fund established. 15k in savings and $8,000 in a CD set to mature this month (back when it was at like 4%)

I am adding around $800 to my savings each month.  

I'd assume the smart move would be to eliminate the only debt I have and hope this housing market comes down from the moon?",1632157384
88,personalfinance,Any studies comparing investing in real estate vs index funds?,"I would like to know if anyone has conducted a study comparing investing in real estate vs investing in index funds.

91,personalfinance,Buying out Auto Lease and Immediately selling,"Not sure if this is right forums but here is goes.

With the way used car prices are, I’m looking to get out of my lease, as it hardly gets used anyway, if I can make some money on it. 

Currently 8 payments left. Current private party buyout is $20,600. Current trade in value is $25k. Current DEALER buyout is $27k (US bank is not keen on dealer buyout apparently).

I want to get a loan for the $20k, buyout myself, trade in for $25k and cash the check. I know I’ll have to pay sales tax on the $20k. My question is if anyone has experience getting an auto loan and immediately selling. Most places offer no early payment fee, but I can’t get many details on how quickly the process goes. I don’t want to buyout my lease, then be stuck with it for 6 months while waiting for paperwork and such.

For the record, we are financially secure, and would have no problem sitting on the payment for the next 8 months and turnout back in. But I’m always looking to make easy money when I can.",1632157155
93,personalfinance,An insurance company has been taking money out of my elderly parents account for 6 years without telling them. I only just found out. What can I do?,"Backstory:

My parents aren't great with online banking at all, and I only just noticed a $39/mo insurance charge on their checking account now.

My mom previously had a term life insurance policy with ING, which is now Voya Insurance (in the United States). She cancelled it back in 2015, and is very sure she did this. We have not received any statements in the last 6 years. 

We called the company and 4 different agents couldn't locate her policy at all, based on her social security number. After a few days, a ""supervisor"" called and said she found my mom's policy immediately. She later said she actually found 2 policies with my mom's name and even gave us the bank account number of the policy. Turns out, the bank account they gave us was for someone else's account with the same name as my mom (giving us the bank account for someone else is probably a huge violation first of all). 

After all this mess, the insurance agent is now claiming she in fact does see my mothers policy in the system and its active. She claims that my mother never cancelled it, they have no paperwork of the cancellation, and they checked all phone recordings and don't have a call recorded with this.

Since the money came out of the checking account directly (not credit card), we can only get 3 months refunded to us via Chase bank. Meaning the insurance company took out close to $6,000 from my parents account.

Some suspicious things:

* We never got a statement ever in the last 6 years at all. The insurance lady is saying they are not required to do this since its term life insurance and the money came out of a checking account directly Sounds very fishy. Isn't this legally required?
* The charge was $39 exact every month. Term life insurance usually goes up annually based on age. 
* Aren't they required to record all calls? Can we ask for all call transcripts? We'd be able to locate the call where my mom called in to cancel, unless they deleted the record.

It sounds like the insurance company simply forgot to turn off the auto-charge and left it running, and are now covering their tracks by claiming the insurance was always active.

What can we do in this situation? We already changed the checking account completely, so they can't auto-charge the account anymore. Chase bank can only refund 3 months of charges.

Can we go to a lawyer for this?

95,personalfinance,How do I prove lack of income?,"I'm an adult living with my parents, who cover my expenses. I was recently hospitalised and intend to declare bankruptcy as a result. I'd also like to apply for the Emergency Broadband Benefit on the basis of falling below the federal poverty guideline. However, both of these require proof of income that seem to be reliant on actually having a non-zero income. I've never had an income, so I don't have pay stubs or tax returns to prove anything. Is there a gap where people who don't make any income at all are excluded from government programs or am I missing something?",1632156027
97,personalfinance,Home equity loan for vacation rental and college?,"Mid 40's, married w/ 2 kids.  Own home worth approx $975k, owe $550k, recently refi'd at 2.88%.

Would like to access equity to put downpayment on vacation rental, to be used by family but rented (short-term, ABNB) for approx 90% of the time to offset the cost on it.

Thinking about home equity loan for the downpayment, but also to pull out some money for kids (13 and 12) college savings, which I currently have approx $20k each for.  Have a 401k loan that ends in 12 months, leaving me with about $700/mo, that I would've saved for the kid's college, which would've added an additional $17k principal to each of their balances over the next 4 yrs (would continue through school).

I was thinking of pulling 80k for the 2nd home downpayment and another 80k to throw into college savings.  Seems like I have enough equity to do this, but wondering if it's a good financial idea..  The $80k for College would be deposited into a 529, where it would presumably accrue interest, but offset by the home equity loan interest....

Any thoughts?  Better options?",1632155735

99,personalfinance,"Low credit, repossession underway and short time frame to get my life in order","so, i got thrown into the “adult life” at a very sudden moment. everything was going good, my own apartment, my very first car, then 6 months later my car went kerplunk. turns out it has over 3000$ worth of issues, the turbo blew at 102k miles on top of a plethora of suspension issues. i’m upside down on the loan by about 6 grand. i figure no big deal, my grandma has an extra car i can use for transportation to get back and forth to work while i save up to get it fixed. nope! i ended up totaling her car about three weeks into the ordeal. i hit some construction companies building and i have yet to know how much i’m being sued for but her insurance company (i was a secondary driver on the policy) already let us know there is a court case underway and we will be billed for the majority of the damages. 

so let’s get to where i am right now. i moved in with my co worker to get back and forth to work. i currently have 700$ to my name and a credit score that stands at about 577 however! my banks credit score simulator says after i pay off my credit card debt (600$) it *should* jump to 650, that is! so long as i’m current on all of my repossessed cars notes. my lemon notes are 360$/m and i called the finance company and they said the repossession shouldn’t hit my credit until about November. so the goal is to get another vehicle before then, preferably something new so i don’t end up getting another lemon. i make ballpark 2.7k a month, but it widely varies because i work in the server industry. 

so here’s where you guys come in, what other things can i do to help my credit BEFORE the repossession hits? my goal is to get it as high as possible to refinance my repossessed cars loan and to be able to get the best rates on a new vehicle. 

i’ve still got the option to get the lemon back? but they told me even if i take the car back it’ll still be listed as a repossession because i fell late on a payment funneling all my money into fixing it. some fixes came about but i owe 12.7k on the loan currently. i seriously doubt if i let them hold onto it it’ll sell for anything more than 3k but what would be the point of me holding onto it? so do i go get the car back or do i let them sell it to shave off on the loan. do i get it back and attempt to use it as a trade in and snowball the negative equity into another loan, if that’s the case i’ve attempted at several places including carmax and all the financing companies wanted me to pay a down payment totaling what i owed after i did the trade in. 

from what i understand late payments aren’t reflected on my credit report until 30 days past due so do i let this payment slip until the last minute to help me get back on my feet as fast as possible or stay on top of them and risk not getting a worthy down payment by the time my credit gets raped by a repossion.

what do i do when i get billed for the wreck? do i file chapter 13 on everything to help me really bounce back or just chapter 7 on the bill?",1632155600
