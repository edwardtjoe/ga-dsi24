5 Criterias self-review:

The presentation starts with the motivating problem for the research and why it’s being presented.
Every slide shows something relevant to the motivating problem.
Every slide shows no more information than necessary to convey the message.
Slide titles stand on their own; other text supports the visuals.
The audience takes away the presenter’s desired message.

1. Problem statement was too vague, especially the call to action. This makes a big problem throughout because the audience does not know what the results will recommmend. Should put out a stronger problem statement/call to action.

2. There was explanation and observation but how does it relate to the problem statement? May be necessary to link it to the bigger picture. If it's background, then what are we trying to say about it?

3. Some slides could be improved to focus on what is truly necessary while eliminating others (eg the pairplot can be removed to just create 4 separate kdes to be compared side by side)

4. I think it's okay

5. Audience did not take away message because of weak call to action. There was no clear thing to do next.
